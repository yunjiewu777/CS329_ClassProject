The Heritage Foundation ’ s Ed Haislmaier told ███ that Congress ’ s health care bill acts as damage control for Obamacare .
Haislmaier told Breitbart that the House ’ s American Health Care Act ( AHCA ) will move health care in the right direction , although , the Senate can make improvements to the bill . He said , “ It is progress , and now it moves over to the Senate . The Senate is really the final decision maker where it is really going to make a difference . ”
The Heritage scholar added that he likes the idea of a tax credit to purchase health insurance , however , there could be better ways to model the tax credit . He said , “ I think the problem with the House ’ s tax credit is that they could have more thoroughly modeled different ways of doing it , and hopefully in the Senate , they can have several variants and come up with a better design . ”
Senator Bill Cassidy ( R-LA ) proposed a solution for higher premiums that would auto-enroll Americans without health insurance into a basic , catastrophic health care plan paid for by an individual ’ s federal tax credit . The Louisiana senator explained , “ Your best way to lower premiums is to expand the risk pool … auto-enrollment would allow expansion of the risk pools . ”
Haislmaier noted some of the complexities behind the idea of auto-enrolling Americans who forgo health insurance . He stated :
As for auto-enrolling Americans without health insurance , you are mainly talking about a group of low-income people who choose not to buy insurance even if they are healthy . It ’ s a practical question how do you make that work and stay with it , and especially for people who are loosely connected to the workforce , and don ’ t have a lot of income and usually go to a clinic to get care . This is the problem with expanding Medicaid ; it does not do a lot to change their behavior , it does a lot more to get the hospital paid . So there ’ s a number of issues you have to think through on that , that I believe they have to do . Once you enroll people , how do you keep them in the system ? They do not want to pay nominal premiums , and that ’ s what happened with Obamacare . With Obamacare , we got them insured in very subsidized coverage , and the insurers were surprised that once they were healthy , they would not even pay ten bucks to keep the coverage . It is a technical issue , how do you work through that and make it better ?
Haislmaier told ███ that the Senate bill should mirror the MacArthur amendment to lower premiums . The MacArthur amendment allows states to obtain waivers to rollback Obamacare regulations . He said :
It is not easy to balance out covering pre-existing conditions with lower premiums , that is where you saw some of the political difficulty in the House , and that ’ s how they came up with the solution of the MacArthur amendment , which allows states to lower premiums through a waiver . I think that the process , doing this as part of a budget reconciliation , means that the best you can get out of this is some sort of waiver system .
Haislmaier responded to some critics of the AHCA that the bill does too little , too late . The state waivers for Obamacare regulations would only apply as early as 2019 and only if the state applies for the waiver . Haislmaier pointed out :
That ’ s why they tied in some additional stabilization funding , they recognized that some of the regulatory actions could not be done right away and to make it acceptable for reconciliation they have to tie some money to the bill . They ’ re going to offer states additional funding and other regulatory relief with the expectation that they ’ ll use the extra funding to initially to keep things going for the next year or so before the relief can kick in . Keep in mind the target here is not the subsidized ACA exchange market , the target is the market that ’ s tied to it , the non-subsidized regular insurance market , that ’ s where the spillover effect is . That ’ s where everyone is experiencing higher premiums , deductibles , loss of insurers , and providers , and they ’ re getting nothing in return . What they ’ re trying to save is the market outside of the exchanges , for the individual and small employer plans . The ACA dumped a whole bunch of costly people to that market , and you got to disentangle that and keep those non-subsidized people and keep insurance affordable for them . What they ’ re trying to do with the stabilization funding is to provide insurers with some stabilization to help bring down premiums . This is a rescue effort at this point . There is a number of things that the Trump administration has done for 2018 , and they can do more things for 2019 and beyond . Congress under the best circumstances , would not have been able to affect health insurance plan year 2018 , what Congress is working on is for further down the road .
Haislmaier told ███ that Congress ’ s efforts for repealing Obamacare basically amounts to damage control , not true health care reform . He explained , “ Let ’ s be clear this is not health reform , this is damage control for Obamacare . There ’ s a lot more to be done . It ’ s not going to happen overnight . ”
