WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Elizabeth Warren on Friday proposed $ 20 trillion in federal spending over the next decade to provide health care to every American without raising taxes on the middle class , a politically risky effort that pits the goal of universal coverage against skepticism of government-run health care .
The details of Warren ’ s “ Medicare for All ” plan aim to quell criticism that the Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate has been vague about how she would pay for her sweeping proposal . Her refusal to say until now whether she would impose new taxes on the middle class , as fellow progressive White House hopeful Bernie Sanders has said he would , had become untenable and made her a target in recent presidential debates .
However , her detailed proposal was quickly attacked by her moderate rivals , including former Vice President Joe Biden , whose campaign said it amounts to “ mathematical gymnastics. ” Some independent experts also questioned whether her numbers were realistic .
In a 20-page online post , Warren said a cornerstone of her plan would require employers to transfer to the government almost all the $ 8.8 trillion she estimates they would otherwise spend on private insurance for employees .
“ We can generate almost half of what we need to cover Medicare for All just by asking employers to pay slightly less than what they are projected to pay today , and through existing taxes , ” she wrote .
Campaigning in Iowa , Warren said Friday her plan was drafted with help from top health care experts and economists . “ If Joe Biden doesn ’ t like that ... I ’ m just not sure where he ’ s going , ” she said .
Companies with fewer than 50 employees that don ’ t already sponsor coverage would be exempt from the proposal . And in a nod to unions whose support will be key in the Democratic primary , Warren said that employers already offering health benefits under collective bargaining agreements will be allowed to reduce how much they send to federal coffers — provided they pass those savings on to employees .
Democrats have spent decades debating the proper role of government in health care , and the complicated politics surrounding the issue quickly resurfaced after Warren released her proposal . Biden , who favors building on the Affordable Care Act , slammed Warren ’ s plan as eliminating private insurance coverage and said it still amounts to a tax increase on workers .
President Donald Trump has branded Medicare for All as socialism .
For all the attention being paid to Warren ’ s proposal , Sanders is the chief architect of Medicare for All . He has previously released several options to pay for it , including a 4 % income tax “ premium ” that kicks in after the first $ 29,000 for a family of four — very much affecting the middle class .
Politics aside , some independent experts raised doubts about the Warren campaign ’ s estimates .
“ They are making more aggressive assumptions about the same things we already made aggressive assumptions about , ” said John Holahan , an economist at the Urban Institute who co-authored a recent cost analysis that the Warren campaign is using as a starting point for its estimates .
And then there ’ s the task of passing such legislation through Congress . A Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to approve anything approaching Medicare for All . And if Democrats took the Senate majority , the party almost surely won ’ t have enough votes to break a filibuster .
“ There ’ s the practical application of getting 60 people in the Senate who are going to vote for this , ” said former Iowa Gov . Tom Vilsack , who has consulted Warren on rural policy .
A critical question for Warren is whether her $ 20 trillion cost estimate is accurate . The Urban Institute think tank recently pegged the cost closer to $ 34 trillion over 10 years .
If Warren is underestimating the cost by that much , her predictions about needed tax revenue would come up well short .
“ This seems like an exercise to low-ball the revenues needed to actually make this enormous transition , ” said Emory University economist Ken Thorpe , who has done his own estimates of Medicare for All .
How Warren ’ s proposed employer contribution would work in the real world will get close scrutiny . It could create winners and losers among companies depending on their health care costs , which can reflect such factors as the age of the workforce and the generosity of benefits .
“ It ’ s going to lock in inequities based on companies that have an older workforce with better benefits , ” Thorpe said .
If the transfers from employers to the government don ’ t raise enough money , Warren said she would make up the difference by imposing a supplemental contribution requirement for big companies “ with extremely high executive compensation and stock buyback rates . ”
All told , Warren estimates she could generate $ 20.5 trillion in revenue through a combination of , among other things , higher levies on capital gains and other investments and new taxes on the wealthiest 1 % of Americans .
Some of her other revenue estimates also could hit political snags . Many lawmakers may be reluctant to side with Warren ’ s call to raise $ 800 billion over 10 years by eliminating a Pentagon contingency fund used for anti-terrorism operations . Another $ 400 billion represents dividends from an immigration overhaul , a legislative feat that has eluded the past three presidents .
And a whopping $ 2.3 trillion would come from stronger enforcement of existing tax laws — money that would have to be identified and collected before it could be used .
Over the weekend , Warren and more than a dozen other candidates will be in Iowa , which holds the nation ’ s leadoff presidential caucuses in three months . Health care remains a dominant issue as the first votes of the Democratic contest near .
