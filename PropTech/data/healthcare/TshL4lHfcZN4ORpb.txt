A GOP-authored bid to scrap Obamacare ’ s most unpopular parts breezed through the House but now faces a less certain path in the Senate , where vocal conservatives say the bill doesn ’ t go far enough .
The 240-189 House vote Friday also defunded Planned Parenthood for one year , a part of the package that won praise from pro-life groups even as the conservative Heritage Foundation panned the legislation as woefully short of GOP promises for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act .
Dubbed the Restoring Americans ’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act , the bill would repeal Obamacare ’ s insurance mandates on individuals and employers , and would scrap taxes on medical device sales and generous health plans , an excise known as the “ Cadillac tax . ”
Republican leaders are leveraging a tool known as budget reconciliation that would let the bill pass on a filibuster-proof basis in the Senate . Though President Obama can still veto what Congress produces , Republicans want to prove they can dismantle Obamacare with a simple Senate majority and a GOP president in 2017 .
“ Let ’ s get this bill to the president ’ s desk and let him make a decision . Is he going to finally stand up for American workers and sign this bill ? Or is he going to continue to support a law that ’ s destroying jobs and destroying health care in this country ? ” said Majority Whip Steve Scalise , Louisiana Republican .
Democrats complained it was the 61st time that House Republicans scheduled a vote to scrap all or part of Obamacare while Congress struggles to meet deadlines on the nation ’ s debt limit , highway funding and the federal budget .

“ I don ’ t know why the American public is not outraged over the fact that none of their business is taken care of , but over and over and over again we talk about taking health care away from people , ” said Rep. Louise Slaughter , New York Democrat .
The bill ’ s thorny path through the Senate starts with winning over the chamber ’ s referee , the parliamentarian , who will rule which provisions meet reconciliation ’ s arcane rules .
Already , Republican sponsors stripped out a provision that would repeal Obamacare ’ s yet-to-be-named board on Medicare spending , since the parliamentarian was likely to rule it out of order .
A trio of Senate Republicans — two of them 2016 presidential hopefuls — said the legislation “ simply isn ’ t good enough ” and reneges on repeated vows to repeal the entire law .
“ Each of us campaigned on a promise to fully repeal Obamacare and a reconciliation bill is the best way to send such legislation to President Obama ’ s desk . If this bill can not be amended so that it fully repeals Obamacare pursuant to Senate rules , we can not support this bill , ” Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and two 2016 hopefuls , Sens . Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida , said before the House vote .
The bill passed on the strength of Republican votes , however , with only seven GOP members rejecting it and one Democrat , Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota , voting “ yes , ” though he ’ s opposed Obamacare in the past .
“ With this bill , we can finally confront the president with the reality confronting working families every day : higher costs and lower quality , ” said Rep. Paul Ryan , Wisconsin Republican .
Though he doesn ’ t want the job , Mr. Ryan is on the cusp of replacing John A. Boehner as speaker after he won support from the House ’ s three main factions and swayed a majority of the House Freedom Caucus , a coalition of hard-line conservatives who nudged Mr. Boehner out the door .
Mr. Ryan is putting himself at odds with Heritage on the reconciliation bill , and Friday ’ s vote appeared to split the Freedom Caucus itself . For instance , members such as Reps. Raul Labrador of Idaho , Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and Tim Huelskamp of Kansas supported it , while Reps. Mark Meadows of North Carolina , Ken Buck of Colorado and Matt Salmon of Arizona voted “ no . ”
