Facebook on Tuesday was blocking users from posting some legitimate news articles about the novel coronavirus in what appeared to be a bug in its spam filters .
`` We 're on this - this is a bug in an anti-spam system , unrelated to any changes in our content moderator workforce , '' the company 's vice president of integrity , Guy Rosen , tweeted . `` We 're in the process of fixing and bringing all these posts back . ''
Facebook is blocking users from posting some legitimate news articles about the novel coronavirus in what appears to be a bug in its spam filters .
On Tuesday , multiple Facebook users reported on Twitter that they found themselves unable to post articles from certain news outlets including ███ , BuzzFeed , The Atlantic , and The Times of Israel . It 's not clear exactly what had gone wrong , and Facebook did not respond to a request for comment .
In the face of the mounting COVID-19 pandemic , Facebook has sent many of its content moderators home , saying it will rely more on automated software instead . Alex Stamos , an outspoken former Facebook security executive , speculated that this shift might be to blame .
`` It looks like an anti-spam rule at FB is going haywire , '' he wrote on Twitter . `` Facebook sent home content moderators yesterday , who generally ca n't WFH '' — work from home — `` due to privacy commitments the company has made . We might be seeing the start of the ML '' — machine learning — `` going nuts with less human oversight . ''
Facebook , however , denied that the bug was related to any changes to its content-moderator workforce .
`` We 're on this - this is a bug in an anti-spam system , unrelated to any changes in our content moderator workforce , '' the company 's vice president of integrity , Guy Rosen , tweeted . `` We 're in the process of fixing and bringing all these posts back . ''
