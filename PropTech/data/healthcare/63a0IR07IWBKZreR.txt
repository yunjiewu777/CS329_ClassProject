Employees at an ObamaCare processing center in Missouri with a contract worth $ 1.2 billion are reportedly getting paid to do nothing but sit at their computers .
`` Their goals are set to process two applications per month and some people are not even able to do that , '' a whistleblower told KMOV-TV , referring to employees hired to process paper applications for ObamaCare enrollees .
The facility in Wentzville is operated by Serco , a company owned by a British firm that was awarded $ 1.2 billion in part to hire 1,500 workers to handle paper applications for coverage under the law , according to The Washington Post .
The whistleblower employee told the station that weeks can pass without data entry workers receiving even a single application to process . Employees reportedly spend their days staring at their computers , according to a KMOX-TV report .
“ They ’ re told to sit at their computers and hit the refresh button every 10 minutes , no more than every 10 minutes , ” the employee said . “ They ’ re monitored , to hopefully look for an application . ”
The employee accused Serco of attempting to conceal the lack of work as it continues to hire employees for processing centers in Missouri , Kentucky and Oklahoma . The employee said Serco is compensated for each worker it hires .
The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare services told KMOV-TV in a statement that `` Serco is committed to making sure federal funds are spent appropriately , and the number of Serco staff is reviewed on a regular basis . ''
Last year , the British government launched an investigation into the firm 's parent company , Serco Group , for allegedly overbilling the government by `` tens of millions of pounds '' under a contract to monitor offenders on parole and individuals released on bail , The Washington Post reported .
The Obama administration defended the high-dollar contract at the time .
`` Serco is a highly skilled company that has a proven track record in providing cost-effective services to numerous other federal agencies , '' then-Medicare spokesman Brian Cook said . “ The company has provided exceptional records management and processing support to other federal agencies , similar to work they will do for the marketplace .
