Obama 's poll numbers at same place as George W. Bush 's at this point in his presidency
Timing of crisis is key -- every day brings midterm elections closer , loyalty harder to maintain
With his presidency at a crossroads , President Barack Obama delivered his health care `` fix it '' message with a healthy dose of reflection and contrition : `` I think I said early on when I was running , I am not a perfect man and I will not be a perfect president . ''
At the moment , the challenge is to get back to being a productive president , and those who see a difficult path ahead include veteran Democrats the President counts among his most trusted friends and allies .
`` Can Obama come back ? '' a veteran Democratic strategist asked . `` Yes . But like Carter and ( George W. ) Bush , his downfall is his handling of the job . ''
`` The next few months will tell us whether he will be remembered in the pantheon of successful/consequential presidents in the last 60 years or whether he will be a flawed president whose skills did not match the times . ''
After the President 's lengthy appearance in the White House briefing room Thursday , Republicans were scathing in making the case it was too little too late and proof , to them , Obamacare was collapsing .

Predictable , but an argument that has more weight now is that the President , using his terms , `` fumbled '' the rollout of his signature domestic initiative .
At an Ohio event later Thursday , the President promised to vigorously fight any effort to `` gut '' the law , and as that debate continues , it is the mood among his fellow Democrats that is most important .
Democrats in both the House and Senate mixed praise of the President 's intentions with promises to not trust the administration to fix the problems without guidance from Congress .
This is the new political reality : the President himself acknowledged the rollout was hurting his party 's standing heading into the 2014 midterm election season . While he promised to work hard to turn the political tide , Democrats hoping to be in Washington beyond the end of 2016 -- meaning beyond the Obama years -- will be less and less reluctant with each passing day to trust their fate to his plans and instincts .
Especially because of those polls the President suggested he does n't read .
For Democrats , especially given the timing , the numbers are numbing : Whether you look at the low Obamacare enrollment figures or President Obama 's declining poll standing , what you see is a White House -- and a presidency -- at a crossroads , facing persistent questions about credibility and competence .
The question now consuming Washington is whether this is just a temporary bad turn or a tipping point .

In a more sympathetic take , a senior veteran of both Obama presidential campaigns and the first White House term put it this way : `` I feel for him and my old colleagues . Tough when you 're in the penalty box . ''
That view assumes the penalty clock expires , and the President rallies . Republican missteps in the past -- like the government shutdown -- give many Democrats hope the President 's critics will overreach again and create an opening for a rebound .
Less sympathetic , though , was another seasoned Democrat , this one a veteran of the Bill Clinton White House .
`` They do n't have the time , or the self-awareness , '' to objectively study and learn from recent mistakes , this longtime Democratic operative said of the President and his second-term team .
`` What they do not appreciate is how far away they are from the end of the second term . We had not even had ( Monica ) Lewinsky yet at this point , '' the operative said , referring to Clinton 's White House affair with an intern .
Noting the sagging poll numbers and increasing public complaints from the President 's fellow Democrats , this source , speaking only on condition of anonymity , predicted a rough stretch ahead : `` There will be a ton of stories about the need for new and fresh staff and how Obama needs to open his circle up to people who he does not know , or at least not well . ''
New polls showing the President at new lows in several categories are only increasing a case of Democratic jitters that began once it was clear the Obamacare rollout was going poorly , and that any political advantage Democrats gained from the government shutdown was fading .
The latest Quinnipiac University poll found just 39 % of Americans approve of how the President is handling his job ; 54 % disapprove . Those numbers are similar to President George W. Bush 's standing at this point in his second term . In an especially troubling turn , that same survey found -- even though congressional approval ratings are at an all time low -- voters trust Republicans in Congress as much or more than the President on big issues like health care and the economy .
In the past , the President 's strong personal standing with voters has helped him through stretches when voters question his job performance . But there are signs he can not , at least at this delicate moment , count on that traditional safety net .
The Quinnipiac poll , for example , found for the first time more voters say the Presidency is not trustworthy .
The timing is what makes this rut even more complicated -- and potentially consequential -- for the President and his second term .
Every day brings the 2014 midterm elections closer , and with the President 's standing low , loyalty within his own party becomes harder to maintain .
Evidence of that is abundant , from the Senate Democrats pushing for Obamacare changes , to meetings between congressional Democrats and White House officials this week that turned testy as lawmakers aired their complains about the Obamacare rollout and how it was hurting the party politically .

In Obama 's 2008 campaign , he ran as much against the struggling Bush administration as he did against the GOP nominee . Back then , questions about the Iraq war and the federal response to Hurricane Katrina had put front and center the questions President Obama now faces -- about credibility and competence .
`` There is a very tender and important period for the President , '' said the veteran Democratic strategist . Instead of a Katrina analogy , this Democrat looked for a parallel within his own party -- the Carter presidency .
`` Health care could become his energy shortage , '' the strategist said .
Health care reform was the signature initiative and achievement of the President 's first term , yet the continuing debate over the program , and the administration 's rollout , is now holding his second term agenda hostage . A look back at the State of the Union address from the beginning of this year is a reminder that the President has realized nothing from his wish list , which included news jobs programs , an increase in the minimum wage and major immigration reforms .
Getting things done in the second year -- the midterm election year in which Obamacare is certain to be the central issue -- would be difficult even if the President found a path to improve his political standing . Especially if Democrats lose faith in the White House as Republicans did with George W. Bush and his team .
