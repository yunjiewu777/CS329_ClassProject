        "content": "That aggressive campaign , which produced numerous hearings on the attacks in Benghazi , Libya , as well as on I.R.S . scrutiny of conservative groups , is now increasingly consumed by the health care fight . House Republican leaders empowered four committees \u2014 oversight , Ways and Means , Energy and Commerce , and Education and the Workforce \u2014 to take the lead , with support from other panels , such as the Science and Homeland Security Committees , which have examined computer security .\nMr. Cantor and Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington , another member of the Republican leadership , have also leaned on all 231 House Republicans . A 17-page \u201c House Republican Playbook \u201d walks members through \u201c messaging tools \u201d like talking points , social media tactics and \u201c digital fliers \u201d ; details lines of attack ; offers up a sample opinion article for local newspapers ; and provides an extensive timeline on the health care law and an exhaustive list of legislative responses that have gone nowhere .\nA message of the week is presented to the Republican members at the beginning of each week , Ms. McMorris Rodgers said . A \u201c Call to Action \u201d email chain distributes relevant breaking news . A new website , gop.gov/yourstory , is collecting anecdotes from each member .\nThe goal , according to Ms. McMorris Rodgers , is to use all the \u201c Republican voices we have in the House , the media markets in all the districts we represent , to take our message all over the country . \u201d\nTo Democrats , especially in the White House , the power of the effort stems from using anecdotes to paint a fundamentally misleading picture .\n\u201c There \u2019 s been so much noise and so much misinformation , and this incredible organized effort to block the notion that everybody should have affordable health care in this country , \u201d President Obama told supporters of the health care law this month , \u201c that I think it \u2019 s important for us to step back and take a look at what \u2019 s already been accomplished , because a lot of times it doesn \u2019 t make news . Controversies make news . \u201d\nRepublicans have gone to the floor of the House and the Senate to tell constituent stories of soaring premiums or yawning new deductibles . But on Wednesday , the White House Council of Economic Advisers released a report showing that health care spending had grown by 1.3 percent since 2010 , the year the health care law passed . That is the lowest rate on record for any three-year period and less than a third of the average since 1965 , according to the White House .",

        "date": "",
        "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Chief Justice John Roberts joined the Supreme Court 's four liberals Thursday to uphold the linchpin of President Barack Obama 's plan to expand health coverage to nearly all Americans , a surprise conclusion to a constitutional showdown .\nThe ruling clears the way for the biggest revamp of America 's health-care system since the 1960s\u2014and sets the stage for a renewed political fight over its merits .\nBy a 5-4 vote , the court held the law 's mandate requiring Americans to carry health insurance or pay a penalty valid under Congress 's constitutional authority to levy taxes . The financial penalty for failing to carry insurance possesses `` the essential feature of any tax , '' producing revenue for the government , Chief Justice Roberts wrote .\nThe Surprise Vote : Roberts The pivotal -- and most surprising -- vote to uphold most of the Obama administration 's health-care law came from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts . Read more .\nBut the court handed a consolation prize to the 26 largely Republican-led states that challenged the health-care overhaul\u2014and opened a new door to their resistance . It ruled that the federal government could not expel states from Medicaid if they refused to go along with the expanded eligibility for the federal-state health program that is part of the health-care law .\nThe decision , tensely awaited for months , proved a vast relief to Democrats and Mr. Obama .\nPresident Barack Obama , in a White House speech , gives his reaction to today 's Supreme Court ruling on his health-care law .\nSpeaking at the White House , the president retold the story of a woman with cancer who had to go without insurance and said , `` Because of this law , there are other Americans \u2026 who will not have to hang their fortunes on chance . These are the Americans for whom we passed this law . ''\nLive Chat Recap WSJ 's D.C. deputy bureau chief Tim Hanrahan , health policy writer Janet Adamy , and legal editor Peter Landers took reader questions a few hours after the ruling . Replay the event .\nBut the decision also handed Republicans a sharper message for the fall campaign : They said they would tell Americans who dislike `` Obamacare '' that electing GOP candidates is the only way to repeal it . What 's more , by calling the insurance penalty the legal equivalent of a tax , the court allows Republicans to accuse the president of raising taxes for some .\n`` This is now a time for the American people to make a choice , '' said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney . `` You can choose whether you want to have a larger and larger government . ''\nA noisy and divided crowd waited on the steps of the Supreme Court Thursday for the contentious health care law ruling . As WSJ 's Neil Hickey reports , the 5-4 decision to largely uphold the Affordable Care Act was greeted with shock and celebration .\nThe ruling means that the law 's reordering of the $ 2.7 trillion health industry will move forward mostly as planned , with implications affecting every hospital , doctor , health insurer and drug maker in the nation . About 30 million more Americans are expected to gain coverage , although the Medicaid change could lower that .\nA line of onlookers waited to enter the Supreme Court building Thursday morning to hear the court 's ruling in a landmark case over President Barack Obama 's health-care overhaul law . Evan Vucci/Associated Press Timeline : The Health-Care Debate Read a timeline of events surrounding President Barack Obama 's health-care legislation , from the bill 's path through Congress to the legal challenges . Looking Back : Health Care in America Read about past efforts to change how Americans receive and pay for health care . Supreme-Court Arguments Listen to audio excerpts and explore the transcripts of the health-law arguments at the Supreme Court . Day One : March 26 , 2012\nCompanies said they were relieved to have a greater degree of certainty about what 's in store , and some welcomed the influx of new customers the insurance mandate will provide . Others pointed to concerns , including the complexity of the law and the remaining questions about Medicaid .\nAltogether , the ruling is both a political and a constitutional landmark . It bestows a measure of validation on President Obama 's legislative achievement after two years of relentless attacks and casts a new light on Chief Justice Roberts\u2014a George W. Bush appointee whom some Democrats had pegged as a Republican partisan\u2014reaching across the ideological divide even while reinforcing some long-standing conservative principles .\nNot only did the chief justice revive states ' rights in the Medicaid ruling , he also rejected the principal legal basis the Obama administration invoked to justify the health-care overhaul , Congress 's constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce . Since the New Deal of the 1930s , the Supreme Court had only twice found Congress exceeded its commerce authority , and never for a program designed to expand the social safety net .\nCongress has invoked its commerce power to pass a vast array of laws , from the Endangered Species Act to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , often over conservative complaints that such regulation exceeded the intent of the Constitution 's framers . On Thursday , however , Chief Justice Roberts drew a firm limit on the commerce power , writing that if accepted as the basis of the individual insurance mandate , federal authority would be virtually unlimited .\n`` The Commerce Clause is not a general license to regulate an individual from cradle to grave , simply because he will predictably engage in particular transactions , '' the chief justice wrote . Four dissenting conservatives , Justices Antonin Scalia , Anthony Kennedy , Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito , agreed .\nBut Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , joined by Justices Stephen Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan , said the Commerce Clause was enough to justify the law , which she said `` addresses the very sort of interstate problem that made the commerce power essential in our federal system . ''\nChief Justice Roberts went on to say that the penalty for failing to carry insurance met the criteria for a tax . Because of the court 's duty to defer to the elected branches when possible , the mandate must be upheld , he wrote .\nNeither the label of `` penalty '' nor the fact it was intended to influence behavior mattered , he wrote . The penalty functioned like a tax\u2014and other taxes , such as those on cigarettes , are enacted principally to create incentives rather than raise revenue , he said .\nAlthough the Obama administration always asserted the penalty was valid under the federal taxing power , until Thursday no court had fully accepted that .\nIt was a day of surprises at the court , including the role of Chief Justice Roberts as the deciding vote instead of the usual swing voter , Justice Kennedy . Reading a joint dissent from the bench , Justice Kennedy said the majority engaged in `` vast judicial overreaching '' and decided `` to save a statute Congress did not write . ''\nBefore the decision was read , the packed courtroom was silent . The chief began by rejecting Congress 's power to legislate the mandate under the Commerce Clause . Many in the audience thought he was en route to striking down the law .\nThen , about halfway through his 20-minute recitation , Chief Justice Roberts turned to Congress 's taxing power . Some in the audience expressed surprise as listeners realized the law would survive . Republican lawmakers who had entered the court smiling exited grim-faced .\nWhat It Means for Consumers The health law 's future depends on which party controls the White House and Congress after elections in November . Read More .\nThe court 's decision leaves intact hundreds of provisions in the sweeping overhaul , with major changes to the U.S. health system set to take effect by 2014 . That is the year when individuals and employers will face their coverage mandates . Insurance companies will have to accept all customers regardless of medical history and wo n't be able to charge more to those who are sick .\nNew exchanges are set to open where consumers can purchase health insurance and apply for subsidies towards the cost of premiums .\nThe Obama administration still faces an uphill battle to make that happen in 18 months , especially when the elections could bring to power Republicans who would repeal all or part of the law .\nThe court 's ruling on Medicaid presents new and unexpected choices for states opposed to the law .\nSeven justices agreed that the law 's expansion of Medicaid effectively created a new program . They said it would be coercive to tell states , as the law did , that they would lose existing Medicaid funds if they did n't participate in the new program , although Washington will shoulder at least 90 % of the new costs .\nChief Justice Roberts said that would put a `` gun to the head '' of states , and said participating in the expanded program should be voluntary . Some Republican governors said they might choose not to participate . That could mean some lower earners in those states would lose their chance to gain coverage under the law .\n`` Wisconsin will not take any action to implement ObamaCare , '' said Gov . Scott Walker , a Republican . `` I am hopeful that political changes in Washington , D.C. , later this year ultimately end the implementation of this law at the federal level .

        "topic": "Sen. Murphy thinks he can build an on-ramp to single-payer health care",
        "date": "2017-09-08",
        "content": "With the Republican health care bill apparently dead , congressional Democrats are brainstorming their own ideas for how to transform the health insurance system in case they take back power .\nSen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) has captivated the base with a cry for Medicare-for-all , but other Senate Democrats worry his proposal \u2014 which envisions a vast overnight transformation of the health care system \u2014 will be difficult to pull off .\nNow , Sen. Chris Murphy ( D-CT ) , the latest entrant into the Democratic health care sweepstakes , says he is preparing a plan that would serve as a bridge between the current health care system and the single-payer system that has increasingly become the key demand of the party \u2019 s base .\nMurphy \u2019 s idea : Allow every American , both individuals and companies , to purchase Medicare . Murphy \u2019 s hope is that if enough people purchase Medicare \u2014 and Murphy is confident they will en masse if they can \u2014 then the private health insurance would begin to shrink gradually . As a result , the government will swallow more and more of the private health insurance markets , setting up the trajectory for achieving a single-payer system .\n\u201c I have a feeling if everybody could buy into Medicare , people would choose to do so \u2014 and then you \u2019 d naturally transition to a single-payer system without a massive political fight , \u201d Murphy said in an interview on Friday , citing opinion polls showing the popularity of the government program .\nThe plan is similar to a \u201c public option \u201d \u2014 an idea that was nixed from Obamacare by Murphy \u2019 s predecessor , Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I-CT ) \u2014 in that it also offers a government alternative to , rather than a replacement that would outlaw , private health insurance .\nMurphy \u2019 s plan , first reported by Politico , follows alternative proposals from Sen. Brian Schatz ( D-HI ) and Sen. Sanders and comes as Democrats have moved with astonishing speed to embrace single-payer health insurance . But while Murphy casts his bill as an on-ramp to single-payer , it has important differences with Sanders \u2019 s bill \u2014 differences that make it simultaneously less ambitious , but also perhaps more feasible , than the Vermont senator \u2019 s proposal .\nTo understand why Murphy is casting his proposal as a more feasible way to single-payer , you need to understand Sanders \u2019 s plan .\nSanders \u2019 s bill , set to be released on Wednesday , is expected to create a single government insurer to give Medicare free of charge to everyone in the country with virtually no copayments and no-deductibles . ( Sanders \u2019 s Medicare-for-all bill is rumored to mirror a similar package from Rep. John Conyers ( D-MI ) in the House , explained at length here . ) It would do so very quickly .\nThe clear upside of Sanders \u2019 s model is in ensuring the government provides universal coverage to all Americans free of cost ; the downside is that it would require significant tax increases upfront , and force the 150 million Americans who currently get their insurance from their employer to join the government plan . Sanders advocates argue that the private health insurance should be eradicated\nSen. Schatz \u2019 s plan calls for every American to be able to buy into Medicaid . Medicaid \u2019 s benefits are more generous than Medicare , which may make it more appealing than Murphy \u2019 s plan ; however , it is run by the states and thus leaves some experts worried that Republican governors could torpedo the effort to ensure the poor have adequate care .\nMurphy \u2019 s plan tries to chart a third course . The Connecticut senator \u2019 s bill certainly would be less disruptive \u2014 engendering less opposition from private insurers \u2014 and it would also certainly represent a massive expansion of the government \u2019 s role in giving Americans insurance .\nBut one huge problem about Murphy \u2019 s plan is whether it would truly achieve universal coverage . Twenty-eight million Americans still don \u2019 t have insurance , including many who couldn \u2019 t or wouldn \u2019 t afford the deductibles and premiums of the insurers on the government exchanges . Medicare as it currently exists , rather than how Sanders would transform it , has significant cost-sharing \u2014 which means Murphy \u2019 s plan might price some people out .\n\u201c The question is if you need additional cost-sharing to make it affordable to people with middle incomes , \u201d Murphy said , adding he was open to the idea . \u201c You \u2019 d build it on top of the subsidies in the Affordable Care Act .\nMurphy noted that he may wind up co-sponsoring Sanders \u2019 s bill , as did Schatz . \u201c If I were building a health care system , from scratch , I \u2019 d start with a single-payer system , \u201d he said .\nMurphy has met with Sanders to discuss his alternative plan , according to a source with knowledge of that conversation . After all , Murphy said the two have the same goal .\n\u201c I think Medicare buy-in gets you to a single-payer system . This may be the fastest way to a single-payer system , \u201d Murphy told me .",

        "date": "2017-07-01",
        "content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is rejecting President Trump 's suggestion on how the Senate could promptly pass its ObamaCare overhaul measure -- by immediately repealing the 2010 heath care law and replacing it later .\nThe Kentucky Republican said Friday night that the bill , which includes significant and complex changes to ObamaCare , remains challenging but `` we are going to stick with that path . ''\nHe also riffed on Trump \u2019 s winning campaign slogan , saying , `` It 's not easy making America great again , is it ? ''\nMcConnell , the leader of GOP-controlled Senate , responded to Trump tweeting earlier in the day : \u201c If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now , they should immediately REPEAL , and then REPLACE at a later date ! \u201d\nTrump is trying to revive an approach that GOP leaders and the president himself considered but dismissed months ago as impractical and politically unwise .\nThe Senate introduced its bill about two weeks ago but left Washington for July 4 recess without enough support from the chamber \u2019 s 52 GOP senators to pass the measure . McConnell will need support from at least 50 of them because the bill has no support among Senate Democrats .\nThe GOP-controlled House passed its ObamaCare overhaul bill earlier this month .\nMcConnell 's is struggling to bridge the divide between moderates and conservatives .\nThe president also tweeted his message shortly after Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse appeared on \u2588\u2588\u2588 Channel 's `` Fox & Friends '' to talk about a letter he had sent to Trump making that exact suggestion : a vote on repealing former President Barack Obama 's health law followed by a new effort at a working out a replacement .\nTrump is a known `` Fox & Friends '' viewer , but Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , also claimed credit for recommending the tactic to the president in a conversation earlier in the week .\n`` Sen. Rand Paul suggested this very idea to the president , '' said Paul spokesman Sergio Gor . `` The senator fully agrees that we must immediately repeal Obamacare and then work on replacing it right away . ''\nEither way , Trump 's suggestion has the potential to harden divisions within the GOP as conservatives like Paul and Sasse complain that McConnell 's bill does not go far enough in repealing former President Barack Obama 's health care law while moderates criticize it as overly harsh in kicking people off insurance rolls , shrinking the Medicaid safety net and increasing premiums for older Americans .\nMcConnell has been trying to strike deals with members of both factions in order to finalize a rewritten bill lawmakers can vote on when they return to the Capitol the second week of July .\nEven before Trump was inaugurated in January , Republicans had debated and ultimately discarded the idea of repealing the overhaul before replacing it , concluding that both must happen simultaneously . Doing otherwise would invite accusations that Republicans were simply tossing people off coverage and would roil insurance markets by raising the question of whether , when and how Congress might replace Obama 's law once it was gone .\nThe idea also would leave unresolved the quandary lawmakers are struggling with now , about how to replace Obama 's system of online insurance markets , tax subsidies and an expanded Medicaid with something that could get enough Republican votes to pass Congress . House Republicans barely passed their version of a replacement bill in May , and the task is proving even tougher in the Senate , where McConnell has almost no margin for error .\nModerates were spooked as the week began with a Congressional Budget Office finding that McConnell 's draft bill would result in 22 million people losing insurance over the next decade , only 1 million fewer than under the House-passed legislation which Trump privately told senators was `` mean . '' But conservatives continue to insist that the bill must go further than just repealing some of the mandates and taxes in Obama 's law .\nUnderscoring the fissures within the GOP , conservative group leaders on that call welcomed Trump 's suggestion but said it did n't go far enough because it could open the door to a subsequent bipartisan compromise to replace Obama 's law . At the same time , a key House Republican , Rep. Kevin Brady , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , rejected Trump 's suggestion , contending that it `` does n't achieve what President Trump set out to do . ''",

You understand the math . Obviously it makes things difficult , \u201d Senator Bob Corker said as he left the meeting .\nTrump had taken a hands-off approach to the healthcare debate last week and suggested on Tuesday that he was fine with letting Obamacare fail . Then on Wednesday he switched course and demanded senators stay in Washington through their planned August recess until they find common ground on healthcare .\n\u201c We can repeal , but we should repeal and replace , and we shouldn \u2019 t leave town until this is complete , \u201d Trump said at the meeting .\nTrump made the repeal and replacement of Obamacare , which he has called a \u201c disaster , \u201d a central promise of his 2016 campaign .\nEven with Trump \u2019 s new push , Republican leaders in the Senate face a difficult task getting moderates and conservatives to agree on an overhaul that can pass .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had planned to hold a straight repeal vote next week , but several Republican senators have already said they oppose that approach .\nThirty-two million Americans would lose their health insurance by 2026 if Obamacare is scrapped without an alternative in place , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported on Wednesday , while 17 million would become uninsured next year alone .\nAt the same time , premiums on individual insurance plans would rise 25 percent next year and double by 2026 .\nU.S. President Donald trump speaks during a lunch meeting with Senate Republicans to discuss healthcare at the White House in Washington , U.S. , July 19 , 2017 . \u2588\u2588\u2588/Kevin Lamarque\nThe CBO \u2019 s estimates were unchanged from a previous report that assessed the impact of a 2015 bill to repeal Obamacare that passed the House of Representatives and Senate and was vetoed by Obama .\nDemocrats were swift to highlight the CBO \u2019 s assessment , while Republicans remained silent .\n\u201c President Trump and Republicans have repeatedly promised to lower premiums and increase coverage , yet each proposal they offer would do the opposite , \u201d Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer said in a statement .\nInsurers and hospitals have lobbied against straight repeal , saying the limbo would increase uncertainty and their costs .\n\u201c CBO projects half the country would have no insurers in the individual market by 2020 under the new repeal bill . That \u2019 s a true death spiral , \u201d tweeted Larry Levitt , vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation , a healthcare research group .\nRepublicans say Obamacare is a costly intrusion into the healthcare system .\nBut the party is divided between moderates concerned the Senate bill would eliminate insurance for millions of low-income Americans and conservatives who want to see even deeper cuts to Obamacare , which boosted the number of Americans with health insurance by 20 million through mandates on individuals and employers , and income-based subsidies .\nModerate Republican Senators Susan Collins , Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito said they opposed McConnell \u2019 s plan for a repeal that would take effect in two years . All three attended the lunch with Trump .\nWith Democrats united in opposition to repeal , McConnell can only lose two votes from the Republicans \u2019 52-48 majority in the 100-seat Senate to pass healthcare legislation .\nOpponents of repeal protested throughout Senate buildings on Wednesday afternoon , leading to 155 arrests , police said . Demonstrators returned in the evening to yell as senators arrived for the meeting .\nParty fractures also emerged in the House of Representatives . The chamber passed a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare in May . But on Wednesday , the House Freedom Caucus , the Republican Party \u2019 s conservative wing , filed a petition to vote on a straight repeal .\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan \u2019 s spokeswoman , AshLee Strong , said : \u201c The House passed an Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill we are proud of and we hope the Senate will take similar action . \u201d",

They \u2019 re the 7 million people who buy their own coverage outside of the federal website , perhaps directly from their preferred insurer or through a local broker .\n\u201c They \u2019 re most important because they \u2019 re paying the full premium and they are most vulnerable to rate increases , \u201d Levitt says . \u201c They are getting hit with the increases . If they start to drop insurance , that could lead to bigger premium increases in the future . \u201d\nLevitt and I spoke about why the premiums are going up , whether the law needs a stronger insurance mandate , and whether Obamacare enrollment will grow this year . What follows is a transcript of our discussion , lightly edited for length and clarity .\nWhy are Obamacare premiums going up so much this year ?\nThere are three reasons why premiums are going up so much . The first is that more sick people than anticipated enrolled . Insurers are just catching up to the fact that premiums weren \u2019 t covering their costs . It seems somewhat counterintuitive that this is happening four years after the insurance expansion going into effect , but it \u2019 s really only now that insurers have good data on who enrolled and how much it cost .\nThe second reason is the end of the reinsurance program , which helped pay for very sick enrollees . That expires at the end of this year . So they have to raise premiums to account for the end of that program .\nThe third reason is health care costs seem to be trending back upward . That is affecting Obamacare plans but really all insurance plans .\nSo when you think about these different factors driving up Obamacare rates , does this strike you as a one-time course correction ? Or that we \u2019 re at the beginning of an era with bigger Obamacare rate increases ?\nThat is absolutely the question of the moment : Is this a one-time bump or a sign of worse things to come ? And the shorter answer is we don \u2019 t know .\nIt seems very likely that this is a one-time bump . The upside of these big premium increases is that all those insurers that have been losing money might start to make money . I doubt many people out there would be shedding tears for insurance companies not making money , but these insurance companies have to earn a profit if they \u2019 re going to make the program work .\nThe risk is that premium increases beget more premium increases if some healthy people decide to drop coverage in response to the increases . In the marketplaces , that is not likely to happen because the vast majority are receiving subsidies and are cushioned .\nHere is a smaller number , about 15 percent of marketplace enrollees , who are not eligible for subsidies . They will feel the full brunt of the rate hikes , although some of them might become eligible for subsidies because premiums have gotten so high .\nThe most important group to watch is people buying their own insurance outside of the marketplace , who are playing the full premium . They are getting hit with the increases . If they start to drop insurance , that could lead to bigger premium increases in the future .\nWhy do you think that group \u2014 the people buying coverage outside the Obamacare marketplace \u2014 is the most important to watch ?\nThey \u2019 re most important because they \u2019 re paying the full premium and they are most vulnerable to rate increases . By definition these people are generally higher-income . If they were lower-income they would go into the marketplace , although some new analysis suggests some of them might be eligible for subsidies and aren \u2019 t claiming them .\nSome are sick and are going to hang on to their insurance for dear life . But the group you worry about is people who are healthy , who are buying insurance because they think it \u2019 s the right thing to do . The law requires insurers to look at who they \u2019 re covering inside the marketplace and outside the marketplace when they set premiums . So you have the same increases for everybody .\nEver since the law passed , there have been fears of a so-called death spiral , where premiums go up and healthy people leave the market . That remains highly unlikely because so many of the people are receiving a subsidy .\nBut if healthy people start leaving the marketplaces , which you suggest is a possibility , does that become a death spiral ? Or is there a way the markets can stabilize with losing some of the healthy people ?\nIt \u2019 s definitely possible in some states that there could be a little spiral , if not a death spiral .\nIts really matter of finding an equilibrium , where premiums cover insurers costs , allowing them to earn a little bit of profit , and enrollment is stable . We \u2019 re at that point of equilibrium in a number of states where things are working well . We \u2019 re not quite at that level of equilibrium of all states .\nIn those places , we may not be at the end of the premium increases that are bigger than underlying health care cost growth . But I think the likely scenario in the vast majority of states is that these big premium increases will put insurers on much better financial footing .\nThe Obama administration thinks enrollment on the marketplaces will increase by about 1 million people this coming year . Do you think that \u2019 s realistic ?\nThere are two factors working in the administration \u2019 s favor . The first is they \u2019 ve gotten better at running the program and may have figured out ways to better target outreach efforts .\nThe second is the individual mandate . The penalty may still prove to be too small to get enough people to buy insurance , but I think people \u2019 s knowledge is still catching up as the penalty phases in . It was fully phased in in 2016 ; many people won \u2019 t know that until they file their taxes .\nAt some point this requires a culture shift , where there is just an expectation that you get health insurance . I think partly , because of the divisive politics around Obamacare , we haven \u2019 t yet made that the norm .\nImagine a world where the ACA passed with significant bipartisan support and there was a national effort involving politicians of all stripes and figures , and athletes , all encouraging people to get insured . That is not the world we live in . It \u2019 s more like what happened in Massachusetts .\nDo you think Obamacare \u2019 s mandate is strong enough to make the law work ? Or do you think it will need to be strengthened at some point ?\nI think of the mandate as going hand in hand with the subsidies . It is entirely possible that both the mandate penalty and the premium subsidy are too small to make coverage affordable and convince enough people that they should buy it .\nThe bigger the mandate penalty , though , the more responsibility you have to provide subsidies to make sure the coverage is affordable . We \u2019 ve heard talk during the campaign from Secretary Clinton about increasing the subsidies . It wouldn \u2019 t be a popular issue to talk about increasing the mandate , but both may need to be bigger .",

Kamala Harris Kamala Devi HarrisHarris calls for judicial nominee freeze during impeachment trial Warren-Sanders dispute thrusts gender into 2020 spotlight Deval Patrick knocks lack of diversity in Democratic debate MORE ( D-Calif. ) unveiled a health plan that would provide universal coverage but keep a role for insurance companies , and said she would not raise taxes on people making less than $ 100,000 to pay for it . But other candidates , such as former Vice President Joe Biden Joe Biden Parnas : U.S. ambassador to Ukraine removed to clear path for investigations into Bidens Five takeaways from Parnas 's Maddow interview Parnas : Trump threatened to withhold more than just military aid to Ukraine MORE , disputed that Harris \u2019 s plan wouldn \u2019 t require tax increases for the middle class .\nThe amount of new federal costs associated with candidates \u2019 health plans will ultimately depend on the details of their proposals . Many of those plans have not been fully fleshed out .\nSanders said at an event hosted by The Washington Post last month that he thinks Medicare for All will cost somewhere between $ 30 trillion and $ 40 trillion over 10 years , but that it would be less expensive overall than the current health care system . Analysts across the ideological spectrum have estimated that past versions of Sanders \u2019 s Medicare for All plan would cost about $ 25 trillion to $ 36 trillion .\nSanders put out a white paper earlier this year that included financing options for his plan : a 4-percent \u201c income-based premium \u201d on household income above $ 29,000 ; a 7.5-percent \u201c income-based premium \u201d paid by employers that exempts the first $ 2 million in payroll ; a wealth tax ; and an expansion of the estate tax .\nMarc Goldwein , senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , a deficit-hawk group , said the options Sanders describes as premiums look more like taxes because they are a compelled percentage of taxpayers ' income , rather than a fixed dollar amount .\nHe also said that Sanders 's financing options would not raise enough revenue to pay for his plan .\n\u201c Looking through and eyeballing it , it \u2019 s really hard to see them getting past $ 20 trillion , and I wouldn \u2019 t be surprised if it was closer to $ 15 trillion , \u201d said Goldwein .\nHarris said she backs many of Sanders \u2019 s financing options , including the premium paid by employers , but would only impose the employee premium on workers who make more than $ 100,000 and instead would create a financial transactions tax and tax companies \u2019 foreign earnings at the same rate as their domestic earnings .\nGoldwein said the employer-side tax would be an \u201c indirect tax on the middle class , \u201d since businesses would pass on the costs to employees .\nA spokesman for Harris \u2019 s campaign told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that employers would end up having less in per-employee health costs under the plan than they do currently .\nOther proposals are expected to increase federal costs by less than Medicare for All would , though they would not eliminate premiums like Sanders \u2019 s plan would .\nA proposal similar to the one O \u2019 Rourke supports , proposed by the left-leaning Center for American Progress ( CAP ) , has been estimated to cost $ 2.8 trillion to $ 4.5 trillion over 10 years .\nBoth O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s preferred plan and the CAP proposal would allow employers to continue offering private plans , but they could also sponsor a plan that 's similar to Medicare . Employees would have the choice to enroll in that plan , rather than their employer coverage .\nBiden \u2019 s campaign estimates that his plan \u2014 which gives people the option of a government plan but allows private , employer-based insurance to remain \u2014 would cost about $ 750 billion over 10 years , and that the cost would be offset by increasing taxes on high earners .\nExperts note that candidates are proposing trade-offs : tax increases that eliminate premiums and deductibles . Medicare for All proponents have been making the case that people \u2019 s overall health care costs would decrease even if taxes are higher , as polls show that many Americans could be scared off by the tax hikes .\nA survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in January found that overall support for Medicare for All drops when people hear that it would require most Americans to pay more in taxes . At the same time , favorability for the plan increases when people are told it would eliminate premiums and reduce out-of-pocket health care costs for most Americans .\nBrodie , who directs the foundation \u2019 s survey research , said the U.S. is in the \u201c early stages \u201d in the debate over Medicare for All , and that the public doesn \u2019 t have a strong understanding of what it would entail , so arguments from supporters and opponents are more likely to sway public opinion .\nA poll conducted by Kaiser in July found that Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would prefer lawmakers build on ObamaCare rather than replace ObamaCare with Medicare for All . Similarly , a Monmouth University survey released Thursday found that a majority of likely Iowa Democratic caucusgoers prefer a health plan where people can opt-in to Medicare over Medicare for All .\nPatrick Murray , director of Monmouth \u2019 s polling institute , said that the preference for a public option among Democrats has more to do with concerns about losing private insurance and viewing Medicare for All as unrealistic than concerns about tax increases . But that could change in a general election , and Democratic voters who aren \u2019 t personally worried about tax increases might be worried about how Medicare for All would play in a general election , he added .\n\u201c If we were polling a general electorate , we \u2019 d be talking about the tax issue as well as concerns about losing private insurance , \u201d Murray said .\nLinden , of the Roosevelt Institute , said he thinks it \u2019 s a mistake for Democrats to attack other Democratic candidates \u2019 health plans over tax increases , arguing it \u2019 s misleading to focus just on taxes if people will ultimately have more take-home pay .\nBut Jim Kessler , vice president for policy at the center-left think tank Third Way , said there 's no guarantee that employers will pass on any savings they receive to employees . He also said there may not end up being cost savings in the U.S. health system under a single-payer plan , and that it depends on the reimbursement rate for doctors and hospitals .\nKessler said the debate in the primary on taxes to finance health plans is important \u201c because if Democrats don \u2019 t have it internally , they \u2019 re going to hear it when the general election starts . \u201d",

        "content": "Washington ( CNN ) - Congress itself is now having so much trouble signing up for the Obamacare exchanges that late Friday the top administrator in the House of Representatives laid out a backup plan in case lawmakers and staff ca n't get through the process by the time their enrollment ends Monday .\nThe red flags started reaching critical mass Thursday and Friday , when some staff and members of Congress told House administrators they were having trouble enrolling through the Washington health exchange , known as DC Health Link . The D.C. exchange is the official signup portal for Congress , where members must go to get health care through their job .\nThursday night the chief administrative officer of the House sent an e-mail , obtained by CNN , to thousands of Congressional staffers bluntly describing a problem .\n`` We have made the Office of Personnel Management ( OPM ) and DC Health Link aware of the significant problems preventing Members and staff ... from enrolling in a healthcare plan via the DC Health Link website , '' Dan Strodel wrote .\nBut the spokesman for DC Health Link , Richard Sorian , disputed that anyone has been blocked from enrollment .\n`` We have not had any capacity problems , '' he told CNN . Sorian said that volume has increased as Congress nears the Dec. 9 deadline for its enrollment .\nSo far , Sorian says , one-third of all Congressional members and workers who are designated to go on the exchange have enrolled . About half have filled out applications and started looking at plans .\nThat leaves a large group that has not enrolled yet and could mean a rush of people signing up Monday , though Sorian notes that many eligible staffers may be getting healthcare elsewhere , such as through a spouse 's plan .\nAmong those who still need to enroll are many members of Congress .\n`` I tried to get on the exchange , so did my staff , but none of us could , '' House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers , R-Kentucky , told CNN .\n`` I tried to get on the website for over an hour , '' echoed Rep. Randy Weber , R-Texas .\nThe reports of problems led to an unusual step by Strodel \u2013 setting up a backup plan . He sent an e-mail Friday night to all members and staff designated to go onto the exchanges . The e-mail , also obtained by CNN , stipulates that anyone who tries to get through the D.C. exchange but ca n't enroll by the end of the day Monday will have an additional week to contact his office and sign up .\nIn addition , Strodel took the unusual step of opening up House payroll and benefits offices this weekend so that staffers and members could come in person to see if their enrollment has been confirmed by the DC Health Link .\nWhile many offices expressed frustration with signup at the end of the week , a large number of staffers also insisted that the process worked smoothly for them .\nSabrina Singh , an aide to Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D-Illinois , told CNN that she enrolled in the D.C. exchange in 15 minutes Thursday . As has been the case across the Obamacare exchanges , it could have been a problem of peak usage overwhelming the system .\n`` I know some people were frustrated , but I went later in the day and enrolled with no problem , '' Singh said .\nSingh admitted that other staffers had trouble getting on the site .\nThe mixed experience will end Monday one way or the other . The DC Health Link will only allow congressional staffers to sign up until then . After that , anyone who could n't enroll in a plan will have to go to the backup plan .",

        "content": "Republicans on Wednesday dismissed the notion that President Obama 's decision to delay a key part of his health care law would keep them during the 2014 elections from hammering Democratic candidates who supported the legislation .\nDemocrats are defending 21 Senate seats , compared to 14 for Republicans . The GOP had already started to attack Senate Democrats who voted for the 2010 law .\nThe House has voted more than 35 times since taking control of the chamber in 2011 to repeal or at least defund all or parts of ObamaCare , most recently in May .\nThe administration is delaying until 2015 the law \u2019 s so-called employer mandate that requires medium and large companies to provide coverage for their workers or face fines .\nAdministration officials said last Tuesday afternoon in announcing the delay that the decision was in response to business leaders expressing concerns about \u201c the complexity of the requirements \u201d and the administration needing more time to effectively implement the requirements .\nHowever , within minutes of the unexpected announcement political strategists argued the move had added value in taking a political hammer away from Republicans -- who immediately struck back .\n\u201c If Democrats thought delaying ObamaCare would make it easier for them in 2014 , they thought wrong , \u201d Matt Gorman of the National Republican Congressional Committee announced on Twitter .\n\u201c We believe this will still be a key issue in 2014 , \u201d said Daniel Scarpinato , national press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee . \u201c Democrats will still have to defend this law . \u201d\n`` I 've heard from countless employers in Maine who say that the onerous penalties and provisions in ObamaCare provide perverse and powerful incentives to not hire new workers or to cut back on the hours that their employees are allowed to work , '' said Sen. Susan Collins , who faces re-election next year .\nJohn Brabender , a strategist and long-time adviser for former GOP presidential candidate and Sen. Rick Santorum , said on Wednesday that \u201c Republicans should galvanize on this issue . \u201d\n\u201c They should make a very loud point that the president knows what a disaster this bill has created and that he is ready to raise the white flag \u201d he told FoxNews.com .\nBusiness leaders also applauded the change , saying it was a smart yet obvious move .\n`` Employers need more time and clarification of the rules of the road , \u201d Randy Johnson , a U.S. Chamber of Commerce senior vice president , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , adding the administration `` finally recognized the obvious . ''\nTyler Harber , a Republican strategist and partner in Harcom Strategies International , called ObamaCare \u201c an unworkable law \u201d that will burden small businesses with huge costs whether the mandate is implemented now or later .\n\u201c The delay has done nothing but fuel Republican arguments that ObamaCare isn \u2019 t ready for prime time and has not diminished the liability that it is for Democrats in 2014 and 2016 , \u201d he said . \u201c In fact , delaying the employer mandate may guarantee that Republicans pick up the White House in 2016 since ObamaCare could be responsible for the largest shuttering of small business the United States has ever seen when the employer mandate is actually implemented . \u201d\nThe announcement also appeared to have no impact on Republican governors and legislators who have steadily undermined a Medicaid expansion that had been expected to provide coverage to some 15 million low-income people .\nAmong the first elected Republicans to respond to the announcement was House Speaker John Boehner .\n\u201c The president 's health care law is already raising costs and costing jobs , \u201d the Ohio congressmen said Tuesday evening . \u201c This means even the Obama administration knows the 'train wreck ' will only get worse . \u2026 And it underscores the need to repeal the law and replace it with effective , patient-centered reforms . ''\nStill , Democrats supported the president 's decision to delay the mandate .\nAdam Jentleson , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry , Reid , D-Nev. , said in an email , `` Both the administration and Senate Democrats have shown -- and continue to show -- a willingness to be flexible and work with all interested parties to make sure that implementation of the Affordable Care Act is as beneficial as possible to all involved . It is better to do this right than fast . ''\nUnder the health law , companies with 50 or more workers must provide affordable coverage to their full-time employees or risk a series of escalating tax penalties if just one worker ends up getting government-subsidized insurance . Originally , that requirement was supposed to take effect Jan. 1 .\nMost medium-sized and large businesses already offer health insurance , and the requirement was expected to have the biggest consequences for major chain hotels , restaurants and retail stores that employ many low-wage workers . Some had threatened to cut workers ' hours , and others said they were putting off hiring .\nBusiness groups complained since the law passed that the provision was too complicated .\nIn addition , Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce 's oversight panel embarked Wednesday on an investigation of Obama \u2019 s decision , seeking documents from the Treasury and the Health and Human Services departments .",

Some Republicans , facing re-election in swing districts , are openly suggesting that some measures should remain .\nOthers worry that the Republican leadership has yet to detail what the party would replace the health care law with . Representative Nan Hayworth , an ophthalmologist and a freshman Republican from New York , said she and others have a clear framework : bolstered health savings accounts , the option to purchase insurance across state lines , medical malpractice limits and a government-subsidized insurance pool for sick people who can not buy insurance on their own . But those alternatives have not been broadly aired .\n\u201c We need to start expressing our principles promptly , \u201d she said .\nSuch concerns are a sharp contrast to the first repeal vote , when a new , vigorous Republican majority was confident that they owed their triumph to voter anger over the health care law . Democrats were on the defensive , with all eyes on which survivors of the 2010 midterm tsunami would switch their votes for the law and embrace repeal . The House voted 245-to-189 to undo President Obama \u2019 s signature domestic achievement , with three Democrats joining in .\nRepresentative Pete Sessions of Texas , chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee , said the health care law was passed \u201c with deception at its core \u201d \u2014 a penalty for those who fail to purchase insurance has been unmasked by the Supreme Court as a tax on the middle class . He said he was still convinced that the issue would be \u201c probably the biggest driver \u201d ensuring Republican victory in November , outside of the tax increases that could come next year with the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts .\nHis deputy at the Republican Congressional Committee , Representative Greg Walden of Oregon , was more circumspect .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to be talking about jobs and economy , but there are lots of elements to that discussion , one of them being health care , \u201d Mr. Walden said .\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box .

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee started an advertising campaign Monday morning portraying Republicans as controlled by insurance companies and intent on taking away the popular consumer protections in the law . A series of news conferences are planned that will include real-life families whom Democrats say would be harmed by repeal .\nBut they will also frame the repeal vote as a political stunt , taking Congress \u2019 s time away from job-creating legislation . A video to be released Monday will use Speaker John A. Boehner \u2019 s oft-repeated phrase , \u201c Mr . President , where are the jobs ? \u201d to mock the repeal exercise .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a strong sense that we don \u2019 t want to carry on this fight , over and over , \u201d said former Gov . Tim Kaine of Virginia , a Democrat who is running for the Senate . \u201c Let \u2019 s move on . \u201d\nFor Republicans in solidly conservative districts \u2014 a majority of Republicans in the House \u2014 the repeal vote is a no-cost way to energize the base and prove to angry constituents that the fight has not ended .\nRepresentative Patrick McHenry , a Republican from western North Carolina , spoke of \u201c fire and passion for repeal \u201d still seething in his district .\n\u201c Activist and average folks regularly bring up full repeal , \u201d he said . \u201c They \u2019 re still keenly aware of it , demand it and understand this law is holding back economic growth . \u201d\nBut Republican campaign consultants are more cautious .

How a rehashing of the health care debate will affect independent voters is less clear .\nDemocrats are driving the narrative that voters are ready to move on . Dan Maffei , a former House Democrat from upstate New York who is campaigning to get his seat back , is using the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision to push the debate toward improving the health care law he helped pass , not whether it should stay or go . To him , another vote \u2014 the 30th this Congress has held to repeal or partially repeal the law \u2014 is more evidence of the rut Washington is in .\n\u201c They \u2019 re stuck in this eternal recurrence , rerunning the debate on the bill over and over again instead of moving forward , \u201d Mr. Maffei said .",

        "date": "",
        "content": "Anyone with the intestinal fortitude to subject themselves to the legacy media will have seen countless \u201c news \u201d stories about the devastation wrought by President Trump \u2019 s \u201c sabotage \u201d of Obamacare . A typical headline appeared a couple of weeks ago in the Washington Post : \u201c Americans are starting to suffer from Trump \u2019 s health-care sabotage. \u201d This work of fiction claimed that the number of working-age Americans without health insurance had risen to 15.5 percent , a 3 point increase since 2016 . But a report just released by the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , says the real number is 12.8 percent \u2014 exactly what it was in 2015 .\nThePost story used a phony number cooked up by a left-leaning think tank to produce a transparently false narrative about the effect of the President \u2019 s policies on the \u201c Affordable Care Act. \u201d And the Bezos Post is by no means unique in its desire to deceive the public . NBC recently reported that the total number of uninsured Americans rose by a preposterous 3.2 million in 2017 . According to the CDC , however , \u201c There was no significant change from the 2016 uninsured rate. \u201d The percentage is , like the working age statistic , precisely what it was in 2015 . NBC , parroting the Post , based its uninsured propaganda on an unreliable source .\nThe media mendacity exposed by the CDC report didn \u2019 t end with the mythical effect President Trump has had on the number of uninsured Americans . It also debunked widely reported propaganda about how Obamacare achieved its hopelessly lackluster results in reducing the percentage . The actual reduction never came close to the preposterous projections made by the Democrats and the White House and parroted by the media when the \u201c Affordable Care Act \u201d was foisted on an unwilling electorate in 2010 . The statistics did improve somewhat , however , depending on how one defines the term \u201c health insurance . \u201d\nIf one defines that term as \u201c a plastic card that doctors are unwilling to accept because its associated payment rates aren \u2019 t enough to cover the cost of treating a patient , \u201d Obamacare did increase the number of people with these useless cards . And you can see them packed like sardines in America \u2019 s emergency rooms , which is where most receive primary care . These are , of course , the able-bodied adults with incomes above the federal poverty level ( FPL ) that were dumped into the Medicaid program . And , despite the lies promulgated by the media , this group of people constitutes at least half the progress Obamacare made in reducing the uninsured rate .\nThe CDC indicates that the number of working age Americans who gained insurance via Medicaid rose from 15 percent when the law was foisted on us to 19.3 percent in 2017 . This comes to about 8.5 million new Medicaid enrollees . During the same period , the number of uninsured Americans declined by 19.3 million , meaning that about 10.5 million found insurance from some private entity . Obviously , many got coverage through their employers or some other source than the Obamacare exchanges . A very conservative estimate would put this figure at 2 million , meaning that more than half the \u201c newly insured \u201d Americans got useless plastic cards .\nNonetheless , the usual suspects in the legacy media continue to pretend that Medicaid is actual insurance , regardless of the reluctance of doctors to treat its enrollees and a well-documented record for producing abysmal health outcomes . Among the people who still insist that it is real health insurance is Paul Krugman , the alleged economist who bloviates for the New York Times . Krugman has repeatedly reviled President Trump and congressional Republicans for sabotaging Obamacare , and recently denounced them for the crime of permitting states to impose work requirements on enrollees . In his indictment he makes the following bizarre claims :\nObamacare has been a highly successful program\u2026 so now it \u2019 s time for sabotage , which is taking place on two main fronts.\u2026 One of these fronts involves the expansion of Medicaid , which probably accounted for more than half the gains in coverage under Obamacare . Now a number of Republican-controlled states are trying to make Medicaid harder to get , notably by imposing work requirements on recipients .\nIf dead-enders like Krugman really cared about the patients , they would welcome any attempt to free them from Medicaid . A multi-year study dubbed the \u201c Oregon Health Experiment , \u201d whose results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May of 2014 , has demonstrated that health outcomes for Medicaid patients are no better than those enjoyed by the uninsured . Scott Gottlieb , the current Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration , summarized various Medicaid studies in the Wall Street Journal and also concluded that being covered by Medicaid is demonstrably worse for your health than having no coverage at all .\nThe CDC report doesn \u2019 t weigh in on this issue , of course . It just attempts to show us where the uninsured rate was and where it is now . But that is damning enough . It not only shows that the projections originally touted for Obamacare were wildly off the mark \u2014 it was supposed to have brought the non-elderly uninsured rate down to 7.6 percent by 2016 \u2014 it demonstrates that the Democrats and their media co-conspirators have been lying about what the real uninsured numbers are as well as President Trump \u2019 s role in their mythical increase . Not that this is new . The Democrats and the media have been lying about Obamacare from day one .",

        "content": "President Obama needs to rebuild confidence in the law . | REUTERS W.H . back to Obamacare sales mode\nPresident Barack Obama will launch a coordinated campaign Tuesday by the White House , congressional Democrats and their outside allies to return attention to why the Affordable Care Act passed in the first place .\nAfter two months of intense coverage of the botched HealthCare.gov rollout , the president will host a White House event kicking off a three-week drive to refocus the public on the law \u2019 s benefits , senior administration officials told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe White House will take the lead in emphasizing a different benefit each day until the Dec. 23 enrollment deadline for Jan. 1 coverage . The daily message will be amplified through press events and social media by Democratic members of Congress , the Democratic National Committee , congressional campaign committees and advocacy organizations , officials said .\nThe fresh push is an attempt to get back to the game plan that Democrats wanted to pursue before the faulty website forced them into full-time damage control . The president needs to rebuild confidence in the law among the public and his Democratic allies on Capitol Hill , who have threatened to roll back aspects of Obamacare if the insurance marketplace didn \u2019 t improve quickly \u2014 and refocus attention on what would be lost if it were repealed .\nNow that the website appears to be mostly functional , the West Wing thinks it has the ability to return to sales mode .\n\u201c Healthcare.gov met our self-imposed November 30th deadline and even as we continue to make improvements to the website , we \u2019 ll also remind the public about how the Affordable Care Act is already making a positive difference in the lives of millions of Americans today , \u201d said Josh Earnest , a White House spokesman . \u201c The benefits of these consumer protections will only accumulate in the weeks and months ahead . \u201d\n( \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine : How the media missed the two biggest Obamacare screw-ups )\nObama won \u2019 t declare the website fixed during Tuesday \u2019 s event . White House officials acknowledge HealthCare.gov still isn \u2019 t working as smoothly as it should , and that this renewed messaging push will run alongside efforts to make further repairs to the insurance marketplace and to target key populations for enrollment .\nBut he will return to a theme he first pursued in October : Obamacare is more than a website .\n\u201c What the White House is doing is what the White House had hoped they would spend the last two months doing , which is going out , selling the law , selling the benefits of the law , \u201d said a former Obama adviser who framed the shift as a sign of White House confidence . \u201c The fact that they feel comfortable doing that is a healthy sign for the president but also for the long-term benefits of Obamacare . \u201d\nRepublicans aren \u2019 t expected back down from their campaign to weaken the law , and officials said they have been preparing for the Democratic offensive .\n\u201c Democrats will spend the next year promising to \u2018 fix \u2019 ObamaCare , but they \u2019 ve already lost all credibility with voters , \u201d said Brad Dayspring , spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee , which has already cut a web ad aimed at vulnerable Democrats that concludes with the message : \u201c They can \u2019 t be trusted to keep their promises . \u201d\nThe focus on Obamacare benefits is a political necessity for congressional Democrats , the large majority of whom will face voters in less than a year . Democrats wrote and passed the law in the face of unified Republican opposition , and if voters aren \u2019 t aware of the law \u2019 s upside \u2014 or can \u2019 t remember it amid all the problems with the rollout \u2014 Democrats will be holding onto an anchor rather than a buoy .\nDemocrats in the White House and on Capitol Hill say that in order to get back on offense on Obamacare , they have to draw a two-sided picture : Democrats delivering benefits on one side , and Republicans trying to deny them on the other . That , one party operative said , is what polling says will help them win . Instead , Democrats have spent the past two months blaming a president of their own party for the deficiencies of a law that they own .\nNow , Democratic leaders are welcoming the renewed White House push .\n\u201c The consequences of Republican repeal are exactly the case that we need to be making \u2014 because Republican repeal would take us backward to a broken system that hurts too many Americans \u2014 like forcing millions of seniors to pay $ 1,200 more for their prescription drugs , \u201d said Rep. Steve Israel ( D-N.Y. ) , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee . \u201c Every poll tells us that when we make that case , voters choose Democrats . \u201d\nOn Wednesday , the White House and Democratic allies will focus on how Americans are paying less for preventative care under Obamacare . On Thursday , they \u2019 ll highlight that people with preexisting conditions can no longer be charged more or denied coverage . And on Friday , they \u2019 ll emphasize the slowing growth in health care costs .\n\u201d We are able to hit reset on the conversation , \u201d said Lori Lodes , senior vice president of the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund . \u201c We have to make sure people understand how the law will benefit them . \u201d",

        "content": "\u201c I never knew a time when I didn \u2019 t have the best insurance in the world. \u201d Frank Hawkey , 70 , held a union job at the Bethlehem steel mill in Northampton County , Pennsylvania , for 31 years , right up until the plant closed in 1996 . Hawkey , like a lot of his former colleagues , recalls the camaraderie of the place , the practical jokes that would break up a shift , how all the families would get together outside work for birthdays and barbecues .\nAnother thing the former steelworkers all remember : how good the health coverage was .\n\u201c When I was at Bethlehem Steel , we \u2019 d get billed zero , \u201d Hawkey said . \u201c And that was probably one of the biggest cultural shocks in the world , when we lost our healthcare . When they went bankrupt , we lost our insurance . \u201d\nThe steelworkers truly needed health insurance . The most common injuries in the plant were from collisions with moving objects , as iron ore and additives were smelted and shaped into super-hot beams that rolled through the mill , except when they jumped the track . Between 1965 and the mill \u2019 s closure , 45 people were killed at the plant , according to Frank Behum , a former steelworker and oral historian .\n\u201c This was the most dangerous steel mill in the United States , and the local people never knew it , \u201d Behum said . \u201c Osha [ the occupational safety and health administration ] didn \u2019 t come in until 1974 , and it actually wasn \u2019 t fully implemented until 1980 . And that made a big difference . \u201d\nThe steel era is gone , taking with it thousands of \u201c womb to tomb \u201d jobs that came with comprehensive health benefits . In Northampton County , fewer people are getting injured on the job , but residents now contend with new health challenges : obesity , heart disease , cancer , drug addiction .\nThe need for care is still there , but affordable coverage might not be . Judging by dozens of interviews in recent months , frustration about healthcare was a significant factor at the ballot box when , last November , Northampton County voted for Donald Trump for president , after having voted for Barack Obama twice .\n\u201c My healthcare payments just kept going up , every month , every year , \u201d recalled a lifelong Northampton resident named Rachelle , 36 , who did not want to give her last name because she works in education and wanted to keep politics out of it .\nRachelle was a Democrat who voted twice for Obama , before switching her party registration in March to vote for Trump during the Republican primary season , as many other Democrats in Northampton County did . \u201c I think I finally woke up , \u201d she said . \u201c I finally realized that Donald Trump \u2013 he spoke to the common folk . \u201d\nHours before Rachelle spoke with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the Congressional Budget Office had released a report on the Trump-endorsed Republican plan to replace Obama \u2019 s healthcare law . It said that 14 million people would be ejected from insurance rolls by next year , healthcare costs for low-income patients would increase , while tax breaks would be delivered to top earners .\nRachelle said she did not believe the media reports . She trusted Trump to get healthcare right .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s still too early to determine , and I \u2019 d like to wait and see how this will roll out , \u201d she said . \u201c I trust whatever \u2019 s he \u2019 s going to do . I am sure they are going to make it work . \u201d\nFrank Hawkey , the steelman , did not vote for Trump , in part because he viewed the candidate \u2019 s promises to bring back American manufacturing as patently false . \u201c Trump says he \u2019 s going to restart the steel industry \u2013 well , I \u2019 ve got news for him , and it \u2019 s all bad , \u201d Hawkey said . \u201c The older guys , they don \u2019 t believe it . They \u2019 re realists . The steel mill \u2019 s not coming back . No two ways about it . \u201d\nStill , Hawkey said , some Democrats who lived through the heyday of steel bought into Trump \u2019 s promise . If you can say , \u201c I never knew a time when I didn \u2019 t have the best insurance in the world , \u201d the slogan Make America Great Again might resonate .\nThe realization that the Republican healthcare plan could be devastating for people who depend on healthcare subsidies has been attended by wrenching stories from across the country of low-income Trump supporters with major health problems who are alarmed at the idea that they could now lose care as a result of Trump \u2019 s win .\nThat \u2019 s not the main story in Northampton . Enrollment here in Medicaid , the subsidies program for low-income patients , is slightly below the national average . The top two employers in the county are healthcare networks , both of which have drawn on federal funds for their continued expansions , in exchange for which they are required to provide a significant amount of free or reduced-rate care . People say access to care and the care itself are generally good .\nWhat is unusual about Northampton County \u2013 and one reason healthcare was such an influential issue here in the 2016 election \u2013 is how immediate the pressures of the global marketplace can seem to the average voter . Many people here still remember how the dumping of foreign steel on the American market , beginning in the 1970s , hastened the decline of the local industry .\n\u201c One of the big things everybody voted for was healthcare , \u201d said Ken Kraft , a locally based business agent for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades . \u201c We \u2019 re competing in everything against companies that don \u2019 t pay for healthcare . Here we have to pay a certain percentage . That \u2019 s paying for the competition to compete against us . So that \u2019 s a strong reason to vote against the status quo . \u201d\nWhile a scathing Trump critic himself , Kraft said more than half the members of his union had voted for Trump , many because they bought Trump \u2019 s promise to make US businesses more competitive by controlling healthcare costs .\nWith its confluence of freeways , railroads and rivers , and its proximity to the ports of the eastern seaboard , Northampton has an unusually high number of homegrown firms that compete in global markets , including Victaulic ( industrial piping ) , Follett ( refrigeration ) , Crayola ( art supplies ) , and Martin Guitars ( great tunes ) .\nRichard Master is CEO and founder of MCS Industries , Inc , the leading US supplier of picture frames and decorative mirrors , with $ 170m in sales , 160 US employees and factories in Mexico and China . He started the business in Easton , in east Northampton County , on the remnants of a box company his father had founded in 1948 .\n\u201c Our healthcare bill for those 160 workers is $ 2m , and the average cost per hour is $ 8 to $ 10 an hour , \u201d Master said . \u201c Particularly for family plans , it is a huge , huge expense , a huge part of the overall compensation package for workers .\n\u201c We need to be competitive with the world , and that \u2019 s why healthcare , which is so expensive in the United States , is a major concern if we \u2019 re going to reindustrialize consumer products here in the US . \u201d\nMaster , a former Bernie Sanders supporter who produced a documentary film called Fix It : Health Care at the Tipping Point , believes that the announcement by the Pennsylvania health department last October that insurers had requested increases in premiums of 25 % or more had given a boost to Trump in the election .\n\u201c This information came out in the weeks preceding the election , \u201d Master said . \u201c Policies were being canceled . Old policies were being canceled . There were new policies that were proposed with high double-digit increases . And I think this had a very significant impact on this election . Nationally and certainly locally . There were front-page articles in the local newspapers about this . And it was alarming . \u201d\nAfter the steel plant closed , Frank Hawkey was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin \u2019 s lymphoma . His insurer summarily dropped him , citing what it viewed as a pre-existing condition , he said . He went a couple of years without coverage before regaining insurance through his wife \u2019 s food distribution business . Now he \u2019 s on Medicare .\nBethlehem , Pennsylvania : the town that built America \u2013 in pictures Read more\nHawkey said protections in the Obama law for people with pre-existing conditions were reassuring to him . \u201c To this day , pre-existing conditions mean a lot to me , because \u2013 I don \u2019 t know if they could kick you off Medicare , but I \u2019 m sure they could stop treating you . \u201d\nComplaints about Obama \u2019 s healthcare law in Northampton County are easily come by . When the current executive , John Brown , took office in 2014 , the county faced a penalty under the so-called \u201c Cadillac tax \u201d provision of the law , which was designed to combat distorted tax incentives that led some employers to take out excessively costly healthcare plans .\nFor the coverage it offered its 1,850 full-time employees , Northampton County faced a penalty of $ 9.4m , to kick in from 2018 , a penalty that would have grown in future years , Brown said . \u201c It seemed to be an overly punitive part of the law for taking very good care of your employees , \u201d he said .\nTo avoid the penalty , he came up with a complex solution using multiple insurance policies to keep up the quality of care for his workers \u2013 but he was left feeling that a a system intended to put the care of ordinary workers first had failed by over-regulating a considerate employer .\nBut for all the complaints about Obama \u2019 s healthcare act , one doesn \u2019 t have to go far in Northampton County to find someone who loves the law , and views the current Republican effort with trepidation , or worse . Few of the stories are as dramatic as that of Jennifer Newland , who lives in Roseto , in the northern part of the county .\n\u201c Two years ago , I was diagnosed with stage 4 liver , colon and lymph node cancer , \u201d said Newland , who now works for a Democratic state representative . \u201c I had no symptoms at all . \u201d\nShortly before her diagnosis , Newland had left a job and had been offered coverage through Cobra for $ 354 a month , with a $ 2,500 deductible .\n\u201c I was like , \u2018 Oh my gosh , how is this going to work ? \u2019 \u201d Newland said . \u201c So I looked at the ACA [ Affordable Care Act ] . And I ended paying $ 149 for a $ 300 deductible plan . \u201d\nThen came the cancer diagnosis . Newland sought treatment in the Lehigh Valley hospital network .\n\u201c There were no hurdles . It was so smooth , \u201d she said . \u201c They would have a nurse call me . They would have a caseworker call me . They would check in all the time to make sure \u2013 Did I have any questions ? Did I need any more help ?\n\u201c At one point I said to them , could I have physical therapy , because I \u2019 m just not feeling strong ? And they were like , \u2018 absolutely \u2019 . It was kind of like , no questions asked . If this is the care that you feel you need to get back to 100 % , we \u2019 ll provide it for you . \u2019 \u201d\nNewland \u2019 s cancer is in remission . \u201c The ACA literally saved my life , and I couldn \u2019 t be prouder to stand up for it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c This whole repeal effort really has me worried for the people out there that continue to have it . That \u2019 s really a huge issue for me . I \u2019 m sad for the people who might lose their insurance .\n\u201c Even with Trump , I hope that he sees the light . I hope that he gets to hear stories of people that the ACA has touched . \u201d",

        "date": "2013-08-26",
        "content": "Some 10,000 baby boomers will retire every day for the next 19 years , including many doctors . But at the same time , more people will be looking for health providers under ObamaCare -- meaning there could be a potentially wide numbers gap between those seeking treatment and those available to provide it .\nDr. Jeff Cain , President of the American Academy of Family Physicians , explains , '' we have an increasing population , we have more Americans that are getting older that need more health care . And with the 30 million Americans that are newly insured with the affordable health care act , more people are looking for primary care . ''\nIn fact , medical colleges predict a huge shortage -- of more than 90,000 physicians by 2020 and a whopping 130,000 or more by 2025 .\nNot only that , Cain notes , `` almost a third of family doctors in rural America are thinking about retiring in the next five years . ''\nAvik Roy of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research , a conservative think tank , adds that on top of retiring baby boomer physicians , `` there are a lot of doctors who are just so frustrated ; today with all the bureaucracy involved in taking care of patients that they 're retiring early . ''\nDr. Ramin Oskoui , president of the medical staff at Sibley Hospital in Washington , says `` one of the great misconceptions about ObamaCare is that just because you have health insurance , you 'll therefore get adequate health care and you 'll have access to it . I think nothing could be further from the truth . ''\nThe health care law did set aside $ 900 million in scholarships for primary care workers and $ 230 million to increase medical residents , nurses and physician assistants , especially nurses .\nThe president praised the role of nurses recently and said , `` there 's a lot of stuff they can do in a way that , frankly , is cheaper than having a doctor do it , but the outcomes are just as good . ''\nThose efforts will create 1700 new primary care workers by 2015 , but analysts argue that wo n't be nearly enough .\nJohn Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas points to Massachusetts as an example , noting that `` in Boston right now , where they say have universal coverage , the wait for a patient to see a new doctor is two months and that 's the longest wait in the whole country . `` ;\nSen. John Barrasso , R-WY , who is also a doctor , argues `` the health care law put a lot of money into hiring more IRS agents to enforce the law , but not that same kind of focus on training more doctors and nurses and others to take care of patients . ''\nSeveral states have passed laws to let nurses and physician assistants play a larger role , although the American Medical Association opposes such moves .\nBut those efforts wo n't produce tens of thousands of doctors to confront the tsunami of retiring baby boomers and the newly insured under ObamaCare .",

        "date": "2013-11-19",
        "content": "The approach the Obama administration has taken to fixing Healthcare.gov is incremental . They identified hundreds of `` punch list '' items ( read : screwed up things ) and set about fixing them in a logical order , which has at times revealed new problems that they 've then added to the list . It 's an iterative approach , and it 's been ongoing for weeks now .\nThus like a growing child , its changes have been less noticeable to people who interact with it regularly than to people who tuned out in early October and are just now coming around .\nIn just under two weeks , though , the media and the law 's critics will treat Dec. 1 as a sort of unofficial relaunch date -- as if the administration had taken the website down when it realized the extent of the problems and was only planning on relaunching once it was fully fixed .\nThat 's totally understandable . The administration announced a time frame for fixing the site , and has said over and over that it will be working as intended `` for the vast majority of users '' by the end of November . The implication is that people should withhold judgment until the the beginning of December and then give it a second look .\nAdministration officials have been intentionally vague about what they mean by `` vast majority '' and whether non-consumer facing parts of the system -- particularly the channel that transmits enrollee data to insurers -- will be in good shape . But over the weekend an anonymous official told the Washington Post , `` vast majority '' means 80 percent of users .\nLet 's start with the fact that 20 percent is still a pretty big fail rate , before looking at who the 20 percent are .\nThere are two ways to look at -- and thus two ways to spin -- the 80/20 goal , two months after the initial rollout , which barely worked for anyone . The first is that it 'll almost certainly still leave tons of people dissatisfied , and that 's not good enough to constitute `` success . ''\nThe second is that it 'll allow millions of people to enroll quickly and it 'll do a decent job reducing the pent-up demand for benefits . If it had been working for 80 percent of users on day one , or if the administration had made it 80 percent of the way toward its goal of enrolling 500,000 people in private insurance in the first month , we 'd be looking at a much different political and legislative landscape than we are right now .\nBut as Josh Marshall notes here , an awful lot depends on who those 20 percent are , and what the Healthcare.gov experience will be like for them .\nIt turns out not to be quite as black and white as an 80/20 dichotomy would suggest .\nAccording to a government official familiar with the new target , the 20 percent who are unlikely to be able to enroll online are expected to fall into three groups : people whose family circumstances are so complicated that the Web site can not determine their eligibility for subsidies to help pay for health plans ; people uncomfortable buying insurance on a computer ; and people who encounter technical problems on the Web site .\nI think the key questions here are what portion of the 20 percent will encounter technical problems , and will they be as intractable as the problems consumers were encountering in early October ?\nIf it 's a smallish * ( * scientific term ) fraction of the 20 percent , then the people for whom the site does n't work will be a mix of technophobes ( people who would n't be using the site even if its error rate was zero ) and people with complex finances , family situations , etc . Of course , a lot of people have complex finances and family situations . And even though many of them will be used to the logistical difficulties that arise from their circumstances , one of HHS ' key goals must be to isolate those people and figure out how to make their experiences as user-friendly as possible . Not an easy task , but doable , and an easier , singular problem to contend with .\nBut if it 's the reverse , then a large group of people will encounter frustrating error messages , and it will be much easier for Obamacare opponents to flood reporters ' in boxes with screen grabs conveying the site 's failures . In that case , anecdata will dominate the coverage in early December both because reporters love failure , and because they 'll find it easier to pass along 404 error images than to vet any of the thousands of success stories the law 's supporters will highlight .\nEither way , I think it 's fair to assume that the first couple of weeks after Dec. 1 will still be bumpy ones for Obamacare . The `` reboot '' wo n't be a dramatic inflection point . That point will only come if the fixes are adequate to move hundreds of thousands of people past the choke points , through the system and announce a large enrollment spike by the middle of the month .",

        "topic": "Maybe Democrats Should Have Read Obamacare Before They Passed It",
        "date": "2014-07-25",
        "content": "First , a fact . Obamacare 's legislative text reads that tax subsidies administered by the IRS to help Americans pay for health insurance they are federally mandated to purchase reads that those tax subsidies will only apply to people who purchase coverage from insurance exchanges `` established by the State . '' An exchange `` established by the State '' refers to state-run health insurance exchanges , established in ACA section 1311 , as opposed to federally-run exchanges , established in ACA section 1321 . The legislative language is pretty clear .\nWhat ACA proponents want to say is that this just amounts to a `` drafting error . '' Congress , of course , intended for the subsidies to apply to the exchanges run by the federal government ; they just made a mistake .\nIt seems odd that we 'd be able to divine the `` intent '' of the general will of 535 people , but some have now fallen back to asking if there was even a single legislator who thought that tax subsidies would n't apply to federal exchanges .\nThis is a good question , because it 's unlikely that any legislator thought that would have been a good idea . But this gets to the heart of the problem with ACA : many legislators did n't know what they were crafting and voting on .\nIn the era of ACA 's crafting , Republicans repeatedly brought up the point that legislators could n't read the bill , because the legislative text had n't been written . The Senate Finance Committee voted on what 's called `` conceptual langauge , '' but did anticipate that some states would not set up their own exchanges . Democrats also insisted that the `` conceptual language '' was enough to actually understand and vote on the law .\nMax Baucus ( D-Montana ) , chair of the Senate Finance Committee through which the health bill flowed , insisted that reading the law was n't necessary .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think you want me to waste my time to read every page of the healthcare bill , \u201d Baucus said , according to the Flathead Beacon . \u201c You know why ? It \u2019 s statutory language . ... We hire experts . \u201d\nSo that 's what happened : in between the `` conceptual language '' and the actual legislative text , some experts who were writing the law thought it was a good idea to try to coerce states into creating their own exchanges by withholding tax subsidies from the federal exchanges . The actual legislators who voted on the legislation did n't know how the law would work , but they trusted the experts they hired .\nOne of the `` experts '' that helped write the law was Jonathan Gruber , an MIT health expert who also helped write Massachusetts ' similar law . Gruber , in 2012 , said that it was actually important that subsidies did n't apply to federally-run exchanges - and that it would be an incentive for states to set them up . The New York Times reported that he went to Capitol Hill to `` help Congressional staff members draft specifics of the legislation . ''\nTom Carper ( D-Delaware ) , who also served on the Senate Finance Committee , insisted that the legislative language was n't important :\n`` I do n't expect to actually read the legislative language , because reading the legislative language is among the more confusing things I 've ever read in my life . ''\nSo , the Senate Finance Committee voted on `` conceptual language '' that established subsidies for exchanges without mentioning who those subsidies would apply to . They then hired experts , as Baucus said , who did intend for subsidies not to apply to federal exchanges , and those experts plainly wrote the law in the way that it would n't apply to federal exchanges . Democratic leadership then refused to post the legislative text for people to read in an adequate time period before passing the law , and as a result , Congress voted on legislation that was written by people who , yes , intended for tax subsidies only to apply to state-established exchanges .",

        "topic": "Leaked 106-Page Draft Shows How Republicans Will Propose to Replace Obamacare",
        "date": "2017-02-27",
        "content": "Earlier in the month , House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters that Republicans would soon introduce tangible legislation to uproot the failing Obamacare status quo and replace it with a better system . GOP leadership released an outline in mid-February that hinted at the approach they were planning to adopt -- and now a more detailed draft proposal has leaked into the press . With all the necessary caveats in place about how the document is by no means a finalized piece of legislation , it provides the most comprehensive and specific glimpse to date at Republicans ' long-awaited Obamacare alternative . Writing at Commentary , Noah Rothman sees a lot to like for conservatives :\n[ This would-be ] bill eliminates most of the onerous , market-distorting provisions contained within the Leviathan ACA . It eliminates many of the subsidies that reduce the incentives for those who are currently outside the labor force to remain there , and it kills the individual mandate to purchase insurance . Based on age , not income , the plan would establish tax credits to help uninsured patients afford private insurance plans . The plan scales back or eliminates some of ObamaCare \u2019 s most burdensome tax provisions , including Medicare surtax on wages and self-employment income . It eliminates federal Medicaid expansion by 2020 , but preserves capped payments to states based on the number of enrollees in states that expanded Medicaid already . Most encouragingly , the plan includes grants to states that would allow them to experiment with programs designed to increase coverage rates or reduce premiums .\nThen again , he argues , other elements appear to partially mimic or tweak Obamacare 's existing provisions . Conservative healthcare wonk Avik Roy also offers a 'mixed verdict ' analysis of the roadmap laid out in the leaked document . He notes that Republicans appear to have abandoned the flawed `` repeal and delay '' strategy , which would have rolled back large swaths of Obamacare via reconciliation , then punted the replacement piece to an undetermined later date . The problem with this idea was that major Obamacare regulations would still have stayed in place even after the law 's ( admittedly faulty ) structure to keep the entire system from rapidly collapsing had been gutted . The resulting market disruptions would have been catastrophic . The introduction and installation of a sustainable alternative plan to supplant Obamacare , as opposed to just creating a yawning Obamacare-less void , is both politically necessary and much more responsible from a public policy perspective . The GOP plan returns regulatory decisions about what viable coverage plans must cover back to the states ( an important departure from Obamacare 's federally-driven mandate bonanza ) , and gives insurers a wider berth for charging younger consumers lower premiums than older ones . These reforms would help create a wider array of available coverage , including cheaper options , and would help stabilize the risk pools that Obamacare is ruining .\nIn place of Obamacare 's federal marketplace and direct taxpayer subsidies , the GOP solution implements a regime of tax credits to assist Americans afford insurance plans . Roy argues that the way in which the draft GOP plan structures the credits is flawed , and also analyzes the proposed dollar amounts -- which range from $ 2,000 to $ 4,000 annually for most people . The proposal also entails critical reforms to Medicaid ( through a form of flexible block-granting ) and Health Savings Accounts ( roughly doubling the amount of money individuals and families can save for medical expenses tax-free ) . It also pumps billions into a modernized version of high risk pools , under which states can innovate and invest to help cover the medical expenses of their most vulnerable citizens . The new law would still prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions , so long as those people have maintained continuous coverage . This strongly incentivizes consumers to obtain coverage without imposing an individual mandate tax ( which is repealed under this plan ) , and while disincentivizing people to wait until they develop a health problem or injury before finally enrolling ( by permitting insurers to charge substantially more to people who seek to sign up after a coverage gap ) .\nOverall , there are disputes and details that will undoubtedly still need to be ironed out . That 's what debates , negotiations and legislative mark-ups are for . I 'd be quite surprised if the eventual legislative language were identical to the draft document , which is a useful and important starting point . Meanwhile , knee-jerk accusations from some conservatives that the plan amounts to `` Obamacare lite '' are unfair ; the core of the troubled law is removed and replaced with a system that massively curtails burdensome federal mandates and taxes , and offers much more flexibility and discretion to the states . These changes , if adopted , would represent a welcome paradigm shift . That said , it 's not as if federal spending , mandates and revenue-raisers will all magically disappear . Helping tens of millions of people have access to affordable coverage is a complex policy challenge . Republicans ' draft proposal seeks to end the current law , then provide needed solutions in a less intrusive and market-distorting way than the current sputtering reality under Democrats ' failed scheme . Finally , with media chatter about town hall meetings on healthcare all the rage these days ( with appalling displays like this receiving scant attention ) , I 'll leave you with a few points : ( 1 ) Conservatives should go out of their way to attend these events and make phone calls to their members ' offices in order to help stiffen GOP spines in the face of intense , and sometimes coordinated , liberal opposition . ( 2 ) Republicans ought to be prepared to defend their positions with compassion and confidence , as quite a few have been doing . ( 3 ) Beware of fake news stories about members `` skipping '' or `` fleeing '' town hall meetings that they 'd never organized or committed to in the first place . ( 4 ) How 's this for a narrative disruptor ?\nNEWS : From MT to WV , the nation 's most vulnerable Senate Dems are avoiding town hall meetings - ABC News - via @ ABC https : //t.co/Wj7pfzFQw9 \u2014 Zack Roday ( @ zackroday ) February 24 , 2017\n- Does President Trump have different plans -- that would leave much more of Obamacare unscathed -- being drawn up by ...

        "date": "2017-04-28",
        "content": "Congress Passes Spending Bill To Avoid Shutdown , Again Punts On Health Care\nWith the clock ticking , Congress on Friday managed to fulfill its basic function \u2014 keeping the federal government running .\nThe House and Senate approved a short-term measure that funds the government for another week . Lawmakers voted hours ahead of a midnight deadline to avoid a partial shutdown of federal agencies .\nFriday 's extension gives members of Congress more time \u2014 until midnight on May 5 \u2014 to try to reach a deal on a spending bill that will last through the rest of fiscal year 2017 , which ends Sept. 30 .\n`` We 're willing to extend things for a little bit more time in hopes that the same sort of progress can be made , '' said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer .\nThe vote caps a dramatic week of deal-making on Capitol Hill , particularly in the House .\nAlthough Republicans control all the levers of power in Washington , Democrats had significant leverage in the spending talks and used it to win concessions from the White House .\nMonday night , President Trump dropped his demand that the spending bill include a down-payment for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border . Democrats said they would not support any bill that included wall funding .\nThe White House later retreated from its threat to stop paying federal subsidies to health insurers that help cover low-income Americans under the Affordable Care Act .\nIf Congress had n't approved the spending bill , the government shutdown would have taken effect on Saturday \u2014 President Trump 's 100th day in office .\n`` I think the president is learning that the all-powerful position of the presidency is not the end-all , '' said Rep. Joe Crowley , chairman of the House Democratic Caucus . `` There is an equal co-branch of government called the legislature , and when it 's properly exercised , it gives an [ opportunity ] for the minority from time to time to play a role . ''\nHealth care victory eludes Trump in his first 100 days\nMembers of Congress left Washington on Friday without voting on the GOP 's revised health care bill .\nThe updated legislation would allow states to opt out of some of the Affordable Care Act 's mandates \u2014 including the benefits health insurers must cover in their policies and the ban on allowing insurance companies to charge more based on a person 's age and health status .\n`` It gives states more flexibility and tools to decrease premiums and increases choices , '' House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters during his weekly briefing . `` And it does this while maintaining and preserving protections for people with preexisting conditions . ''\nHouse GOP leaders faced pressure from the Trump administration to schedule a vote on the bill this week . The White House was eager to claim it as a legislative victory within Trump 's 100th-day marker .\nBut the GOP 's vote-counting team struggled to find the support needed to pass the measure , especially among centrist Republicans . The House Freedom Caucus ' endorsement of the bill made the divide all the more pronounced . That bloc of roughly three-dozen hard-line conservative Republicans helped sideline the party 's previous attempt .\nHouse Democrats had threatened to block the spending bill this week if Republicans attempted to vote on the health care legislation .\nStill , support from the Freedom Caucus injected the GOP effort with a shot of momentum and put political pressure on moderate House Republicans to fall in line . The dynamic fueled tension within the party .\n`` There 's frustration that we are here where we are because of the Freedom Caucus stand three weeks ago , '' said Rep. Chris Collins , R-N.Y. `` And now the hot potato has moved to those of us that are typically the ones that cast the tough votes all the time \u2014 whether it 's [ voting to raise ] the debt ceiling or it 's keeping the government open . ''\nHouse Speaker Ryan says he 'll bring the new health care bill up for a vote only when it has enough support to pass . It 's not clear when or if that will happen with the legislation in its current form .\nThe renewed rift over health care will likely color next week 's negotiations over the longer spending bill , as lawmakers face yet another precarious bout of brinkmanship .",

        "content": "Obama 's Next Big Campaign : Selling Health Care To The Public\nPresident Obama often tells audiences that he has waged his last campaign . But that 's not exactly true .\nThe White House is gearing up for a massive campaign this summer that will cover all 50 states , plus Washington , D.C. And the president 's legacy may hinge on whether it succeeds or fails .\nThe Affordable Care Act , or `` Obamacare , '' has been through more life-and-death cliffhangers than a season finale of Homeland . After squeaker votes in Congress and a 5-4 ruling upholding the law at the Supreme Court , now there 's another big hurdle : getting uninsured people to buy health care when it becomes available Oct. 1 .\nWhen Obama delivered the commencement address at Morehouse College this month , his advice to the graduates \u2014 along with working hard and helping others \u2014 was to sign up for health insurance this fall .\n`` We 've got to make sure everybody has good health in this country , '' he said . `` It 's not just good for you , it 's good for this country . So you 're going to have to spread the word to your fellow young people . ''\nDavid Simas , deputy senior adviser to the president , works in a quintessential West Wing office \u2014 a windowless basement room \u2014 where he oversees one of the top projects on the Obama agenda : implementing universal health coverage .\nIn the first year , the administration hopes to sign up 7 million people across the country . Simas says that will require TV ads , door knocking and lots of word of mouth .\n`` It is an on-the-ground effort , '' he says . `` It is a social media effort . It is a paid media effort . It is an earned media effort . But [ it 's ] all leading to the same thing , which is that man or woman sitting in their living room online , comparing different prices for different products and deciding what works best for them . ''\nThe administration is developing an Expedia-style website , hoping to make the experience as customer-friendly as possible .\nBut just getting people to that website is a huge task . Last month , a Kaiser Family Foundation poll showed that 4 in 10 Americans do n't even know the health care law is still on the books .\nNancy-Ann DeParle , who has worked on this issue for years \u2014 until recently as Obama 's deputy chief of staff \u2014 says that 's not a cause for concern .\n`` The truth is that people were n't paying attention until now , '' she says . `` There 's so much else going on that even if we had wanted to start a campaign two years ago , it would n't have been very effective because people were n't listening . ''\nBut with the sign-up date approaching fast , the administration 's efforts have already stumbled . Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has repeatedly asked Congress for money to implement Obamacare .\nRepublicans have repeatedly said no , while they vote to repeal the law .\nWithout the money she wanted from Congress , Sebelius tried to fundraise for an independent group called Enroll America that is focused on implementing Obamacare . When Republicans heard that she was asking insurance companies and health care providers to donate millions of dollars , they cried foul .\nTennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander told Fox News : `` Congress has said we refuse to give you more money to implement Obamacare , and she 's saying , 'Well then , if you wo n't do it , I 'll go outside and I will raise private money , use a private organization , and do it anyway . ' ``\nNow two Republican-controlled House committees are investigating the solicitations . Dan Mendelson of the health care consulting group Avalere says that makes donors skittish .\n`` Much as a health care company might really want to improve enrollment , they also need to make sure that they do not run afoul of politicians on either side of the aisle , '' Mendelson says .\nIf health care companies hold back , he says , it 's going to be much harder to reach all of those people in all of those communities .\n`` The fact of the matter is that if you starve a media campaign for funding , you 're not going to have the reach that you otherwise would , and that 's the situation that we find ourselves in , '' he says .\nThere 's another key part of this campaign : Sicker and older people without insurance may be eager to sign up Oct. 1 . But to make the system work financially , young and healthy people who do n't need much medical care have to get into the pool , too .\nSo you can expect administration officials around the country to give lots more commencement speeches this season , telling captive audiences of 20-somethings : Congratulations on your diploma . Now make sure to sign up for health coverage in the fall .",
