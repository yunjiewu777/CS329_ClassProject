Is President Obama ’ s latest health care promise – that his plan will offer “ most ” people a better plan for the same price or less than their current policy – actually true ?
`` That ’ s not an accurate argument , '' says Avik Roy of the Manhattan Institute . `` If your plan is now covering a bunch of things that you don ’ t need , then how is it a better plan for you ? ''
Former Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Holtz-Eakin says there 's no evidence to support the president 's claim .
`` You can do the math , '' he says . `` Most of the policies in his claim could spend more , cover more things , provide more visits and charge less . '' But , he concludes , `` the arithmetic just does not work . ''
Obama ’ s remarks last month were an effort to deflect criticism for having earlier promised that people could keep their plans and doctors no matter what .
`` Most people , he said , `` will be able to buy better plans for the same price or even cheaper than what they 've gotten before . ''
A few days after that promise , the president appeared to downgrade the pledge somewhat , saying only that `` there 's a good chance that they 'll be able to buy better insurance at lower cost . ''
The promise that `` most people '' would be better off is sharply disputed by many , including a number of individuals experiencing sticker shock , including those with pre-existing conditions .
They include Tom Gialanella of Seattle , who had a policy that was renewed for years even after he had cancer -- not the kind of sub-standard policy the president likes to criticize .
But he says his new policy under ObamaCare `` went from $ 891 a month to $ 1,437 a month and also my deductibles all doubled . ''
Andrew Leonard recently told ███ ’ Greta Van Susteren that he `` would get the terrible , terrible plan with the $ 6,000 deductible . '' As far as the premiums are concerned , he said , `` I 'll pay $ 1,200 dollars a year for that and I 'll be less insured than I am today . ''
Analysts say those whose policies are canceled will get new coverage , but not at lower prices .
`` What we 're seeing is that the new ObamaCare plans typically have higher deductibles than the old plans did , '' says Roy , along with `` a narrower choice of doctors and hospitals and yet higher premiums . ''
David Hogberg of the National Center for Public Policy Research adds , '' It 's very easy for a bronze plan to have a deductible ( with ) total out of pocket costs that are $ 6,000 . ''
That , of course , means the individual does n't get a dollar of benefits until he or she has exceeded $ 6,000 in expenditures , much more than many young people spend on medical care .
Rosemary Gibson of the Hastings Center and author of `` The Battle Over Health Care '' points to a Nov. 14 letter from one of the top officials implementing the law that concedes subsidies wo n't help everyone .
She describes it as `` a letter from Gary Cohen to state health insurance commissioners saying while many people still have subsidies , there will still be some people who will be paying more than they were paying . ''
In fact , one insurance plan that asked not to be identified analyzed its pool of 375,000 people and found that , even after subsidies , only 10 percent would actually see a decrease in costs , while one third would face significant rate increases as a result of ObamaCare .
