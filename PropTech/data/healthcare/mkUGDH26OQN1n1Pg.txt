Despite pledges by Republicans to take down ObamaCare , some still indicate there are parts in the president 's controversial health care overhaul that could be preserved if the party ever got its wish of repealing the law .
Since the beginning , conservatives in Congress have been extremely vocal about their dislike of Obama 's signature domestic policy achievement .
Yet , as demonstrated by a recent proposal from House conservatives , they say they would n't just repeal the law -- they would replace it with one of their own .
It would n't be ObamaCare . But there could be some similarities , items that despite the widespread public mistrust of the law have bipartisan support . Some combination of subsidies to help people buy insurance and consumer protections to help the sickest get care are recurring themes in any health plan , from either party .
Michael Gerson , former speechwriter for President George W. Bush , on Friday urged Republicans to start thinking along those lines -- of what kind of health care policy they could create , as opposed to simply how they 'd tear down the existing one .
In a theoretical post-ObamaCare period , he argued in The Washington Post , a Republican plan should offer a universal credit to anyone who 's not covered by a large employer . It should include protections for those without insurance from `` catastrophic expenses . ''
Both ideas would be scaled-back versions of the subsidies and consumer protections currently offered in ObamaCare . The difference , Gerson writes , is that `` Obamacare creates a powerful regulatory mechanism ( the exchanges ) that mandates comprehensive coverage '' among other changes .
`` Conservatives do not ( or should not ) oppose Obamacare because they want fewer Americans to receive health care , '' he wrote . `` But making this clear requires an alternative that covers more people at a lower cost , without all the regulations , taxes and mandates of the current system . ''
Indeed , prior GOP pushes at health care reform show an overlap in ideas between the parties , and some now say that parts of ObamaCare would most likely show up in a Republican-penned plan .
`` There is the politics of the moment -- whatever is out there will be attacked -- but if you take a step back , you see that there is a history of Republicans supporting ideologies parallel to what you see in the Affordable Care Act , '' David Kendall , a senior fellow for health and fiscal policy at Third Way , told FoxNews.com .
The law is not so dissimilar , Kendall said , to versions Republicans have pushed in the past , including a universal plan President Richard Nixon offered up at the end of his term .
According to a May 2012 Kaiser Health poll , popular provisions of ObamaCare favored by both parties include letting children stay on their parents ' plans until they turn 26 and providing subsidies on a sliding scale to those who ca n't afford insurance .
Recently , Republican Study Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Scalise , R-La. , called his party 's counter-proposal a 180-degree turn from ObamaCare but a closer look shows some similarities .
The American Health Care Reform Act would use some long-standing conservative ideas for health care , like letting people buy insurance across state lines -- but also give tax deductions , as opposed to subsidies , to help purchase insurance .
The bill would not include what is perhaps the least popular element of ObamaCare - the mandate on almost everyone to obtain insurance .
`` By default , the Republicans will have to use some of the things in the ACA , '' Kendall said . `` They might repackage it but it would offer the same basic choices , subsidies to make coverage affordable and offer some guarantees . ''
One of the biggest selling points in ObamaCare -- as well as in the GOP proposal -- is the coverage of adults with pre-existing conditions . Under the ACA , insurers wo n't be able to turn down consumers who have a history of medical problems or charge them more for coverage .
Among the most hyped and hated parts of ObamaCare have been the exchanges , which are a centerpiece of the health reform plan . The exchanges are marketplaces where the uninsured go to purchase insurance . The rollout of the main exchange websites , though , has been plagued by problems since their launch on Oct. 1 .
The experience would likely leave Republicans hesitant to try to recreate them if they ever were in a position to try their own plan . For now , though , the latest budget fight proved Republicans do not have the numbers or the leverage to repeal -- or replace -- ObamaCare at this point , and may have to wait until 2016 for their next shot at changing the balance of power .
