Story highlights Other congressional leaders have instructed their staffs to enroll
In September , Reid said , `` We are going to be part of exchanges ''
Law lets lawmakers decide if committee and leadership staffers keep federal employee insurance
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , one of Obamacare 's architects and staunchest supporters , is also the only top congressional leader to exempt some of his staff from having to buy insurance through the law 's new exchanges .
Reid is the exception among the other top congressional leaders . GOP House Speaker John Boehner , House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell have all directed their staffs to join the exchange , their aides said .
In the charged atmosphere surrounding Obamacare , Reid 's decision only gives Republicans more ammo to attack Democrats already suffering politically from the law 's botched rollout .
In September , Reid told reporters , `` Let 's stop these really juvenile political games -- the one dealing with health care for senators and House members and our staff . We are going to be part of exchanges , that 's what the law says and we 'll be part of that . ''

That 's true . Reid and his personal staff will buy insurance through the exchange .
But it 's also true that the law lets lawmakers decide if their committee and leadership staffers hold on to their federal employee insurance plans , an option Reid has exercised .
Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson emphasized , `` We are just following the law . ''
`` I 'm sure that regular Americans who just lost their insurance will feel comforted to know that Senator Reid 's staff gets to keep their government plan , '' a senior GOP Senate aide said .
Former Reid staffer Jim Manley defended his old boss , arguing that `` the only people hypocritical here are Republicans , who made this an issue in the first place . ''
And all four House and Senate leaders are required to relinquish their federal employee insurance plans next year and are choosing to enroll in the exchanges .
