President Obama on Tuesday summoned leading CEOs to the White House to showcase support for a broad immigration reform package , telling Republicans that the business community ’ s position should make it “ easy ” to get the measure through the House .
But Republican leaders may not be swayed by their traditional business allies . They point to the failed rollout of Obamacare as clear proof that a massive bill — such as the immigration measure that passed the Senate this year — is the wrong approach and would lead to even greater problems .
House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , and others in his party also may feel emboldened to scrap the Senate plan and move forward with smaller , targeted pieces of legislation after a coalition of influential conservative groups urged them Tuesday to do just that .
“ The House of Representatives is in a unique position to propose genuinely conservative solutions to fix our broken immigration system . We , therefore , encourage the House to continue its work to address the different aspects of the immigration issue in a piecemeal basis , ” reads a letter signed by the heads of the American Principles Project , the American Conservative Union , Conservatives for Immigration Reform , the Hispanic Leadership Fund and other organizations .
The groups urged House Republicans to pursue “ legal status to undocumented immigrants , but not a special path to citizenship , ” a key difference from what the Senate has approved . The groups also called for the establishment of “ market-oriented mechanisms to meet the demand our economy has for foreign workers . ”
“ If President Obama and the Democrats are willing to kill immigration reform in the House because they disagree with these principles , it would show that they are more interested in using the issue politically than actually solving the problem , ” the letter said .
With House action on the Senate bill becoming less likely each day , the president mounted a perhaps last-ditch push to spur Republicans to action and , in turn , give the White House a major victory on one of its key second-term domestic policy initiatives .
At the end of the government shutdown last month , Mr. Obama identified three challenges — a long-term budget , immigration reform and a farm bill — that , he said , realistically could be addressed on a bipartisan basis in the coming months . With a farm bill still in limbo and budget negotiations between House and Senate leaders just getting underway , the president has thrown his full weight behind the push to enact a far-reaching immigration bill and give the administration a badly needed political win .
“ Although right now there has been some resistance from House Republicans , what ’ s been encouraging is there have been a number of House Republicans who think this is the right thing to do , ” Mr. Obama said just before he met with some of the nation ’ s top CEOs , including the heads of McDonald ’ s , Lockheed Martin , Motorola Solutions and Marriott .
“ It ’ s my estimation that we actually have the votes to get comprehensive immigration reform done right now . The politics are challenging for the speaker and others . We want to make it as easy for him as possible . This is not an issue where we ’ re looking for a political win . This is one where we ’ re looking for a substantive win for the U.S. economy . ”
Mr. Obama is correct when he speaks of bipartisan support ; 14 Senate Republicans supported immigration reform when it passed the chamber over the summer .
In addition , a handful of House Republicans have signed on as co-sponsors to a House proposal that mirrors the Senate version .
But amid the troubles with Obamacare and a growing recognition that the White House may have oversold and underdelivered on its health care reform legislation , House Republicans have a new argument to sink the Senate plan and instead pass smaller measures .
“ If the president is insisting on one massive , Obamacare-style bill that people don ’ t understand , we aren ’ t going to get very far , ” said Brendan Buck , a spokesman for Mr. Boehner . “ The speaker has made clear publicly and privately that , while it ’ s important we address immigration reform , the House is not going to consider the Senate plan . Instead , we remain committed to a common-sense , step-by-step approach that gives people confidence immigration reform has been done the right way . ”
Opposition to the Senate bill is coming from quarters beyond Capitol Hill and outside the political realm .
As the president met with the CEOs , the labor union representing Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents wrote a letter to those same business leaders denouncing the plan and calling on the House to make sure it advances no further toward becoming law .
“ Only the U.S. House of Representatives now stands between the American people and the potential destruction of federal immigration enforcement , ” said Chris Crane , the union ’ s president . “ Yet the groups represented on this letter are spending enormous sums of money or wielding enormous amounts of influence in an attempt to intimidate the House into passing a plan similar to that adopted by the Senate . ”
