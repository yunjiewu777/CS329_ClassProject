The opposition was strategic from the start . The Obamacare sabotage campaign
To the undisputed reasons for Obamacare ’ s rocky rollout — a balky website , muddied White House messaging and sudden sticker shock for individuals forced to buy more expensive health insurance — add a less acknowledged cause : calculated sabotage by Republicans at every step .
That may sound like a left-wing conspiracy theory — and the Obama administration itself is so busy defending the indefensible early failings of its signature program that it has barely tried to make this case . But there is a strong factual basis for such a charge .
From the moment the bill was introduced , Republican leaders in both houses of Congress announced their intention to kill it . Republican troops pressed this cause all the way to the Supreme Court — which upheld the law , but weakened a key part of it by giving states the option to reject an expansion of Medicaid . The GOP faithful then kept up their crusade past the president ’ s reelection , in a pattern of “ massive resistance ” not seen since the Southern states ’ defiance of the Supreme Court ’ s Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 .
The opposition was strategic from the start : Derail President Barack Obama ’ s biggest ambition , and derail Obama himself . Party leaders enforced discipline , withholding any support for the new law — which passed with only Democratic votes , thus undermining its acceptance . Partisan divisions also meant that Democrats could not pass legislation smoothing out some rough language in the draft bill that passed the Senate . That left the administration forced to fill far more gaps through regulation than it otherwise would have had to do , because attempts — usually routine — to re-open the bill for small changes could have led to wholesale debate in the Senate all over again .
But the bitter fight over passage was only the beginning of the war to stop Obamacare . Most Republican governors declined to create their own state insurance exchanges — an option inserted in the bill in the Senate to appeal to the classic conservative preference for local control — forcing the federal government to take at least partial responsibility for creating marketplaces serving 36 states — far more than ever intended .
Then congressional Republicans refused repeatedly to appropriate dedicated funds to do all that extra work , leaving the Health and Human Services Department and other agencies to cobble together HealthCare.gov by redirecting funds from existing programs . On top of that , nearly half of the states declined to expand their Medicaid programs using federal funds , as the law envisioned .
Then , in the months leading up to the program ’ s debut , some states refused to do anything at all to educate the public about the law . And congressional Republicans sent so many burdensome queries to local hospitals and nonprofits gearing up to help consumers navigate the new system face-to-face that at least two such groups returned their federal grants and gave up the effort . When the White House let it be known last summer that it was in talks with the National Football League to enlist star athletes to help promote the law , the Senate ’ s top two Republicans sent the league an ominous letter wondering why it would “ risk damaging its inclusive and apolitical brand. ” The NFL backed off .
The drama culminated on the eve of the open enrollment date of Oct. 1 . Congressional Republicans shut down the government , disrupting last-minute planning and limiting the administration ’ s political ability to prepare the public for the likelihood of potential problems , because it was in a last-ditch fight to defend the president ’ s biggest legislative accomplishment .
“ I think my Republican colleagues forget that a lot of people are enrolling through state exchanges , rather than the federal exchange , ” Rep. Frank Pallone ( D-N.J. ) noted last week . “ And if it wasn ’ t for the fact that many Republican governors , including my own , ” failed to set up state exchanges , “ then we wouldn ’ t be putting so much burden on the federal system . ”
In fact , putting an excessive burden on the federal government was the explicit aim of the law ’ s opponents . “ Congress authorized no funds for federal ‘ fallback ’ exchanges , ” the Tea Party Patriots website noted as long ago as last December . “ So Washington may not be able to impose exchanges on states at all. ” The group went on to suggest that since Washington was not equipped to handle so many state exchanges , “ both financially and otherwise — this means the entire law could implode on itself . ”
