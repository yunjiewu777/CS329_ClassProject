( CNN ) House Republican leaders released a package of amendments Monday evening to modify the GOP bill to repeal and replace Obamacare -- the culmination of days of negotiations and closed-door meetings to win over critics and skeptics of the proposal .
The amendments mark efforts by GOP leaders and the White House to appease both conservatives and moderates who have expressed reservations about the bill .
As of Monday , senior Republicans were continuing to whip the GOP conference to ensure that they will have the 216 votes necessary to pass the bill out of the House on Thursday . To ramp up the pressure , President Donald Trump will meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning .
The legislation , called the American Health Care Act , would rewrite the current health care system and lead to millions of more people being uninsured than under Obamacare , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
The bill will be taken up Wednesday by the House Rules Committee and set to be voted on by the House Thursday -- the seven-year anniversary of President Barack Obama signing the Affordable Care Act .
Many of the amendments would make additional changes to Medicaid that were pushed by conservative members .
One addition would give states the option of requiring able-bodied Medicaid recipients to work , participate in job training programs or do community service .
Conservative-leaning members have been especially irked since Obamacare expanded Medicaid to 11 million able-bodied adults without children . Critics , however , say it will make it harder for many low-income Americans to get needed health care .
Also , the revised legislation would allow states to opt to receive federal Medicaid funding as a block grant for the adults and children in their program . The current bill calls for giving states a set amount of money per enrollee , known as a per capita cap system . ( Funding for elderly and disabled participants would be based on enrollment . )
Both would be a major change from the current way Medicaid is funded , which is open-ended federal support tied to state spending on the program .
Under a block grant , states would receive a fixed amount of federal funding each year , regardless of how many participants are in the program . This would reduce federal support for Medicaid even more since the funding level would not adjust for increases in enrollment , which often happens in bad economic times .
Another alteration would immediately prevent states from expanding Medicaid , a concession to conservative lawmakers . Under the first version of the legislation , enhanced funding for Medicaid would be repealed as of January 1 , 2020 , but nothing barred states from expanding the program before that .
House leaders also sought to win support from centrist Republicans from upstate New York leaders by adding a provision that would ban the federal government from reimbursing state Medicaid funds raised by local governments , according to New York Rep. Chris Collins . He told CNN the change would help bring along other members of his state 's delegation who are currently wavering on the bill .
A House GOP aide told CNN the change would apply to New York state only .
In New York , counties outside of New York City send $ 2.3 billion to the state to help pay for Medicaid . The amendment would give the state the incentive to stop passing down Medicaid costs to the counties , Collins said .
House lawmakers punted one important provision to the Senate : Providing more assistance to older consumers , many of whom would face huge premium hikes under the GOP bill . The House is setting aside $ 75 billion to provide additional tax credits to help people buy policies on the individual market , but they are letting the Senate handle the crafting of the legislation .
The American Health Care Act 's tax credits are not as generous as Obamacare 's subsidies for lower-income enrollees in their 50s and early 60s . As a result , the premium for a 64-year-old would be 20 % to 25 % higher in 2026 than it would be under Obamacare , the CBO projected .
Lawmakers have been hammered on this point , with the influential AARP warning that it will inform all 38 million of its members how their representatives votes .
Beefing up the tax credits , however , will make the legislation more costly . By shifting responsibility to the Senate , lawmakers avoid having to have the CBO re-evaluate the plan , while assuaging rank-and-file members to support the bill .
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters on Monday that older Americans were `` hammered the most by Obamacare . ''
`` The promise of Obamacare was that if you made young people pay more , you would pay less . And that failed , '' Brady said . `` So they 're facing skyrocketing premiums . ''
