New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo called on the federal government on Tuesday to supply ventilators , saying the state is in dire need of tens of thousands of machines to manage the coronavirus outbreak . The state expects to receive about 4,000 ventilators per Vice President Mike Pence .
Why it matters : New York state has become the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic , with 25,665 cases , and Cuomo said time is running out to wait on domestic production of medical supplies .
Cuomo said there are two methods to obtain the ventilators , recommending the U.S. government either use the federal Defense Production Act or that Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar tap into the federal stockpile to provide 20,000 machines .
`` I understand the federal government 's point that many companies have come forward and said we want to help , and General Motors and Ford and people are willing to get into the ventilator business . It does us no good if they start to create a ventilator in three weeks or four weeks or five weeks . We 're looking at an apex of 14 days . ... The [ Defense Production Act ] can actually help companies because the federal government can say , 'Look , I need you to go into this business . I will contract with you today for x number of ventilators . Here 's the startup capital you need . ' ... Not to exercise that power is inexplicable to me . ''
What 's happening : The state has 7,000 ventilators and needs 30,000 . New York already mandated nonessential businesses close and ordered residents to stay home .
“ I will take personal responsibility for transporting the ventilators ” elsewhere in the country after New York reaches its apex , Cuomo said . “ I ’ ll send ventilators , I ’ ll send health care workers , our professionals . ”
