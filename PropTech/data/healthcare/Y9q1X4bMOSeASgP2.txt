Nancy M. Schlichting , the chief executive of the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit , said that one patient who visited the emergency room of the system ’ s flagship hospital on Wednesday tried to fill a prescription and found that the co-payment would be $ 84 — more than she was accustomed to paying . She got a similar drug with a lower co-payment , illustrating the need for patients to pay close attention to details of their drug coverage , Ms. Schlichting said .
In San Antonio , at a 24-hour Walgreens store , only a few vehicles were lined up at the drive-through window at midday , and no one was waiting in line to pick up prescriptions at the indoor pharmacy counter .
“ It ’ s dead , ” said Leslie Castillo , a pharmacist on duty . “ We ’ ve had a few regulars come by , but no one has come in today with a new insurance card or wanting us to look up their benefits under Obamacare . ”
One reason , Ms. Castillo said , was that most doctors were not seeing patients on the New Year ’ s holiday . But she added , “ We ’ ll probably be packed tomorrow . ”
Kenneth E. Raske , the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association , said : “ Today is a historic occasion for the health care community . The coverage expansion kicks in for hundreds of thousands of people in New York State and millions across the country , who will enjoy the comfort of knowing they won ’ t have to worry about health care bills if they get sick . ”
Danny Cottrell , the owner of a pharmacy in Brewton , Ala. , said he had helped several people sign up for coverage . One customer , who has $ 3,500 to $ 4,000 a year in prescription drug costs , qualified for federal subsidies and chose a plan with a premium of about $ 300 a month and an annual deductible of $ 500 .
“ He will definitely come out ahead , ” Mr. Cottrell said . “ He will save at least $ 7,500 a year on medical bills . ”
