Some confusion arose over whether the deadline was actually Feb 15 .
WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is seeking to clarify penalty rules for people who delay signing up for coverage under the new health care law .
Simply put : People who wait until the end of the initial enrollment period — March 31 — will not be penalized .
The Obama administration is preparing legal guidance to address a confusion of dates in the law , which says people must sign up by the 15th of one month to receive coverage on the first of the next month .
That means someone who signed up after Feb. 15 would not be covered until April 1 — and the law also says that people who go three months without coverage are subject to penalties , $ 95 or 1 % of household income , whichever is higher .
The White House says that officials are working on new legal guidance to better coordinate the different datelines .

''
He added that `` the individual mandate timing has not changed . The deadline for signing up for insurance was and is March 31 . ''
