FOR DECADES , America resettled more refugees than the rest of the world put together . According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , in 2016 the United States resettled 96,900 people fleeing persecution , war or other violence ; other countries admitted 92,400 . But under President Donald Trump , America has become far less welcoming . Last year it took in only 22,900 refugees , 5,200 fewer than neighbouring Canada , which has a population only one-tenth as big .
Mr Trump wants to cut the numbers further still . On November 2nd he approved a plan to reduce the number of refugees let into America to 18,000 for the year to September 30th 2020—the lowest since the country ’ s current refugee programme was created in 1980 . This is the third time Mr Trump has lowered the cap . In September 2017 he reduced the limit set by Barack Obama , his predecessor , from 110,000 to 45,000 . A year later he cut the figure to 30,000 .

A recent report by the Pew Research Centre notes that the number of refugees admitted has fluctuated with world events and American priorities . In the programme ’ s earliest years—when the cap exceeded 200,000—most refugees came from Asia , notably Vietnam . In the early 1990s over 100,000 a year were admitted , many from the former Soviet Union . Admissions were curbed after the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 , but still ( just ) exceeded the total for the rest of the world . They rebounded thereafter , with Iraq and Myanmar among the main countries of origin . Mr Obama raised the limit to its highest since the mid-1990s .
The Trump administration has defended its cuts on the grounds that refugees pose “ enormous security challenges ” to the country ( even though they are vetted by the Department of Homeland Security before they arrive ) . Officials also argue that federal resources would be better spent dealing with the influx of asylum-seekers crossing America ’ s southern border ( asylum-seekers ask for protection once they are in America , whereas refugees do so from a third country ) . Critics point out , however , that thousands of refugees are being turned away who have already been screened and vetted . In October , according to CNN , the American government cancelled some 500 flights for refugees who had already been approved to enter the country .
As far as the world ’ s refugees are concerned , the timing of the cuts to America ’ s refugee programme could not be much worse . According to UNHCR , the number of refugees fleeing violence and persecution around the world has risen to more than 70m , the highest since the second world war .
