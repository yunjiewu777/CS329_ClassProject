President Obama wants us to believe that debate about the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act is over . “ It ’ s the law of the land , ” he has said .
I strongly disagree . I still believe the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional , even if you accept the Supreme Court ’ s conclusion in 2012 that Obamacare ’ s individual mandate simply imposed a “ tax on going without health care . ”
My attorneys with Pacific Legal Foundation have just asked the Supreme Court to hear my constitutional lawsuit against Obamacare . It focuses on the fact that the Origination Clause ( Article 1 , Section 7 ) requires all “ bills for raising revenue ” to begin in the House of Representatives , the chamber closest to the people . Yet Obamacare began in the Senate . Sen. Harry Reid took an unrelated House bill , gutted it , and inserted the language that became the Affordable Care Act .
Who am I , you might ask , to harbor hope of bringing down a mammoth federal program that has withstood legal assaults by state governments , major businesses and other formidable plaintiffs ?
I ’ m a self-employed artist and small-business owner , living in Washington state . I have no political involvement or ambitions .
I am also a realist . The Supreme Court accepts very few of the cases that are petitioned to it .
But I am hopeful the justices will recognize the urgent issue at stake : Will the Origination Clause — a constitutional protection against reckless and arbitrary taxation — be repealed through the back door , by Congress ignoring it and courts failing to enforce it ?
Obamacare isn ’ t just an unprecedented federal intrusion into our private lives and our personal health care decisions . It is also a voracious revenue-raising machine . All told , its scores of new taxes and fines will siphon more than $ 800 billion out of the economy over the next 10 years , according to Congress ’ s Joint Committee on Taxation . The individual mandate alone will cost $ 55 billion over that period .
The Founders knew that the taxing authority can be “ the power to destroy , ” as Chief Justice John Marshall put it . The Origination Clause was meant to make that power accountable to the people , by requiring taxes to begin in the “ people ’ s House . ”
Unfortunately , in ruling against my case , the U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit severely undermined the Origination Clause as a reliable safeguard for taxpayers against abuse of the taxing power .
The court held that judges can exempt tax legislation from the Origination Clause if they consider its primary purpose to be something other than raising revenue .
“ This vague new test would allow lawmakers and judges to ignore the Origination Clause at will , ” said Timothy Sandefur , my attorney with Pacific Legal Foundation . “ That audacious proposition ought to cause the Supreme Court serious concern . ”
It ’ s been a five-year journey for me to get to this point .
Filing suit in 2010 , I originally challenged Obamacare on Commerce Clause grounds . When the individual mandate was designated a “ tax ” by the Supreme Court , my lawsuit was amended to target the Origination Clause violation .
I am battling for my freedom — and everyone ’ s freedom — to make health care choices without government coercion , and not be subject to micromanaging mandates and taxes that were imposed unconstitutionally .
As I have pointed out from the beginning , I served with the Army National Guard in Iraq as a combat medic , eventually receiving the Bronze Star . I mention that experience because it underscores an important point : While I was proud to volunteer for military service , I object to being conscripted , now , into a command-and-control federal health care regime .
As free individuals , Americans should not be compelled to buy expensive , one-size-fits-all insurance policies concocted by federal bureaucrats . Lawmakers who can ’ t balance the government ’ s books have no business dictating to the rest of us how to budget and allocate our own money for our own health care needs .
Moreover , Congress can ’ t be allowed to ignore the Founders ’ road map for enacting taxes , because those procedures are there to protect us .
One of the things that makes America great is that an average person can carry a fight for civil rights all the way to the highest court . It ’ s daunting to be knocking on the justices ’ door , but also a privilege to be able to take a stand for health care freedom and taxpayers ’ rights — and a core constitutional safeguard for everyone ’ s liberties .
