Opposition to the 2010 health care law has been above 50 percent for over a year . And that continues to be true , as the latest ███ national poll finds voters oppose the law by a 52-41 percent margin .
Support for Obamacare has been as high as 43 percent ( May 2014 ) and gone as low as 36 percent ( January 2014 ) .
The number opposing the law has ranged from 49 percent ( June 2012 ) to a record-high 59 percent ( January 2014 ) .
As in the past , the new poll shows that most Democrats favor Obamacare ( 74 percent ) , while most Republicans ( 84 percent ) and independents ( 61 percent ) are against it .
Voters in every age group are more likely to oppose the law than favor it , with one exception : those ages 65 and over . And that group only favors it by two percentage points .
President Obama receives higher job approval ratings on health care than on almost any other issue : 42 percent of voters approve , while 53 percent disapprove . That ’ s up from a record-low 36 percent approval in March . His highest approval on health care came two years ago , when 48 percent approved and 47 percent disapproved ( September 2012 ) .
And where is Obama doing best now ? It ’ s the economy , although even here his ratings are under water : 43 percent approve vs. 51 percent disapprove .
Approval of Obama ’ s performance is below 40 percent on all other issues tested in the poll , and goes as low as 30 percent approval on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
The ███ poll is based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1,001 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research ( D ) and Shaw & Company Research ( R ) from August 10-12 , 2014 . The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points .
