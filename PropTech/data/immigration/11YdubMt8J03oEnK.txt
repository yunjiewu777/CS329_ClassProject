Donald Trump threw a few punches in Ted Cruz 's direction in an interview aired Sunday , hitting the Texas senator for copying his call to build a wall on the Mexican border and billing himself as being on the vanguard of the national immigration discussion in the presidential campaign .
`` Ted Cruz is trying to step up his whole game on amnesty and on illegal immigration because it was actually quite weak , '' the Republican presidential candidate told CBS ' `` Face the Nation . ''
Asked whether Cruz 's plan is stricter on undocumented workers , Trump said it is not .
`` Well , first of all , his plan just happened , OK ? In fact , I was watching the other day . And I was watching Ted talk . And he said , 'We will build a wall . ' The first time I 've ever heard him say it , '' he continued . `` And my wife , who was sitting next to me , said , 'Oh , look . He 's copying what you 've been saying for a long period of time . ' ''
Trump then said that he was talking about deportation , remarking that people can come back into the country legally and that he wants a `` strong border . ''
`` And I 'm the one that came up with it . Look . When I announced that I was running , I brought up illegal immigration . It was n't even a subject that would have been discussed in this debate . And now it 's one of the very big subjects , '' he said , before referring to Cruz 's game on immigration and amnesty as `` weak . ''
He also lumped Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with Cruz , remarking that both are trying to `` solve the problems that they 've had in the past because they were both weak on it . And I have been very strong on it . ''
`` So they 're trying to get stronger . But , look , nobody has that position like I have that position . I want the wall . I want strong borders . I want everybody out . Now , people are coming to me . But nobody has that issue like me , '' he said . `` And nobody 's going to be able to do it like me . Nobody . As an example , on the wall . Nobody is getting Mexico to pay for the wall , the cost of the wall , but me . They do n't even know about that . That 's not even in their vocabulary . ''
