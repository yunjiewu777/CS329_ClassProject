Obamacare premiums are going up for 2015 . But your Obamacare premium does n't have to .
Multiple experts have sliced and diced the Obamacare health insurance offerings for 2015 , and most , if not all , have found that premiums are rising , on average . They used different criteria for measuring premium changes .
Consumers in the most popular 2014 plan -- the cheapest silver tier plan -- will pay an average of 10 % more for the same policy next year , according to Avelere Health , an advisory firm .

Looking at premiums for all tier levels by state , the average increase is 5.2 % , found Pricewaterhouse Coopers , a consulting group .
Since the exchanges did n't exist before this year , insurers had a tough time pricing their policies for 2014 , said Dan Mendelson , Avelere 's CEO . Now that they have a better idea of the popularity of their offerings and the health status of their newly enrolled , they can set a more precise premium for 2015 .
But all this does n't mean that consumers will pay more for coverage through the exchanges next year .
Many more insurers are offering plans for 2015 so most consumers will have a wider selection in terms of premiums , deductibles , doctor networks and coverage options , experts said . That 's why it 's crucial that people browse through all the Obamacare plans available .
That applies especially to those currently in Obamacare plans . If they do nothing before December 15 , they 'll be automatically re-enrolled and may find themselves paying a lot more for coverage , even if cheaper policies were available .
Even if their policy 's premium does n't increase , however , they could still wind up with sticker shock for 2015 if they received a subsidy . That 's because their subsidy is based on the price of a benchmark , which is the second-cheapest silver plan being offered in their area that year .
The benchmark plan will rise 2 % on average , concluded the Kaiser Family Foundation , a non-profit health policy research firm , which examined costs in every county .
That said , if the benchmark plan in someone 's area carries a lower premium for 2015 , the subsidy levels are recalculated . So consumers who do n't check out next year 's offerings may find their subsidy for 2015 covers a smaller share of their premium , whatever plan they pick .
`` Shopping around is an imperative this year , '' Mendelson said . `` In many cases , they 'll be able to find a lower-cost option . ''
