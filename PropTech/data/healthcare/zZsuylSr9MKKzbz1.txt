Last week , President Barack Obama gathered some of his top advisers in the Oval Office to discuss the problem-plagued rollout of his healthcare legislation . He told his team the administration had to own up to the fact that there were no excuses for not having the health care website ready to operate on Day One .
The admonition from a frustrated president came amid the embarrassing start to sign-ups for the health care insurance exchanges . The president is expected to address the cascade of computer problems Monday during an event at the White House .
Administration officials say more than 476,000 health insurance applications have been filed through federal and state exchanges . The figures mark the most detailed measure yet of the problem-plagued rollout of the insurance market place .
However , the officials continue to refuse to say how many people have actually enrolled in the insurance markets . And without enrollment figures , it 's unclear whether the program is on track to reach the 7 million people projected by the Congressional Budget Office to gain coverage during the six-month sign-up period .
The first three weeks of sign-ups have been marred by a cascade of computer problems , which the administration says it is working around the clock to correct . The rough rollout has been a black eye for Obama , who invested significant time and political capital in getting the law passed during his first term .
The officials said technology experts from inside and outside the government are being brought in to work on the glitches , though they did not say how many workers were being added .
Officials did say staffing has been increased at call centers by about 50 percent . As problems persist on the federally run website , the administration is encouraging more people to sign up for insurance over the phone .
The officials would not discuss the health insurance rollout by name and were granted anonymity .
Despite the widespread problems , the White House has yet to fully explain what went wrong with the online system consumers were supposed to use to sign up for coverage .
Administration officials initially blamed a high volume of interest from ordinary Americans for the frozen screens that many people encountered . Since then , they have also acknowledged problems with software and some elements of the system 's design .
Interest in the insurance markets appears to continue to be high . Officials said about 19 million people have visited HealthCare.gov as of Friday night .
Of the 476,000 applications that have been started , just over half have been from the 36 states where the federal government is taking the lead in running the markets . The rest of the applications have come from the 14 states running their own markets , along with Washington , D.C .
The White House says it plans to release the first enrollment totals from both the federal and state-run markets in mid-November .
An internal memo obtained by The Associated Press showed that the administration projected nearly a half million people would enroll for the insurance markets during the first month .
Officials say they expect enrollments to be heavier toward the end of the six-month sign up window .
Problems with the rollout were largely overshadowed by Republican efforts to force changes to the health care law in exchange for funding the government . That effort failed and the government reopened last week with `` Obamacare '' intact .
Some Republicans are now calling for the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius . The White House says it has complete confidence in her . House Republicans have scheduled a hearing next week to look into the rollout problems .
White House allies say they 're confident the problems are being addressed .
`` There 's no question the marketplace website needs some improvement , '' said Sen. Max Baucus , D-Mont. , one of the architects of the law . `` The administration needs to fix the computer bugs and I 'm confident that they 're working around the clock to fix the problems . ''
