Medicaid gaps are the remnants of political and legal battles that eroded the ACA . Obamacare 's haves and have-nots
ALBUQUERQUE , N.M. — April Gomez-Rodriguez hopes Obamacare changes her life .
Daniel Hughes says it ’ s like the health law never happened .
Gomez-Rodriguez and Hughes are both uninsured . They don ’ t get coverage through their low-wage jobs , but they don ’ t qualify for traditional Medicaid . There ’ s no way they can afford to purchase health insurance on their own .
But Gomez-Rodriguez , 32 , who works with kids at a behavioral health center , lives in New Mexico , where Gov . Susana Martinez was among the first in the GOP to embrace the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act . On Jan. 1 , Gomez-Rodriguez and her husband will have health coverage for the first time in years .
Hughes , 40 , who works in home repair , lives in Texas , where Gov . Rick Perry ’ s staunch opposition to Medicaid expansion and other key elements of Obamacare shut him out .
It wasn ’ t supposed to be this way . Obamacare was supposed to create a health care safety net from coast to coast , across income levels , putting everyone within reach of health coverage . But in some states , there ’ s a gaping hole . In half the states , millions of poor people are left out .
Those gaps weren ’ t part of the law that Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed in 2010 . They are the wreckage of the years of political and legal battles that eroded some of the original promises of Obamacare .
The Affordable Care Act required all states to expand the program to encompass people with household income up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level — about $ 15,000 for a single person , about $ 31,000 for a family of four . The federal government would have paid the bill entirely for the first three years and then gradually phased back to a 90 percent contribution .
The Supreme Court changed that . In a 7-2 ruling last year , the court found that it was unconstitutional to require the states to expand Medicaid . It had to be optional . More than half of the nation ’ s governors have decided not to expand or are leaning in that direction . In an odd quirk of how the law works in the states that opt out , people who are just a tad over the poverty line — from 100 to 133 percent of poverty — can go into the new exchanges and get a subsidized health insurance policy . But the poorest — those with incomes less than 100 percent of poverty , whom the laws ’ authors thought they had protected through Medicaid — have nothing .
Texas is the largest of the 26 states to not expand . As the health law rolls out this month , 5 million low-income Americans like Hughes are left with nothing , according to estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation .
“ You can just cheer all over the United States for everyone else but not for me , because I don ’ t get this opportunity that everybody has worked so hard for , ” says Daniel ’ s wife , Dena Hughes , 44 . “ Philosophically , [ the law ] is great . But right here on the streets of Texas , it ’ s not that big of a difference . ”
Hughes just started a new home repair business . It ’ s hard for him to know exactly what his family will earn , but he estimates it will be just above or below $ 31,590 — the income requirement for a family of six to get tax subsidies next year . If he ’ s below it , he ’ ll remain uninsured . If his new business lets him cross over into a slightly higher income bracket , he may be able to get some help in the exchange .
Texas ’ s Medicaid program is among the most restrictive in the country . Coverage for poor adults is almost nonexistent because the income requirements are so low — about $ 4,000 per year for a family of three . Perry said repeatedly that he was skeptical of expanding Medicaid because of the federal promise to pay the Medicaid expansion bill . He said he feared the feds would cut and run , leaving the states with an enormous bill .
But other governors , like Martinez , thought the feds were offering a good deal . In New Mexico , expansion will cover some 170,000 people in a state that has a big problem with coverage despite a large Medicaid program . According to the Kaiser Family Foundation , New Mexico ’ s Medicaid program covers 22 percent of its population , the fourth highest rate in the country . Even with that help , about one in five people in New Mexico is uninsured , the third highest uninsurance rate in the country .
