Vast spending , frustrating software , angry doctors facing a punch in the wallet — and a hungry new Congress . It could add up to a powerful threat to the Obama administration ’ s $ 30 billion program to digitize the nation ’ s medical records .
Many doctors hate the clunky , time-sucking software they got through the massive subsidy program , and most complain that cumbersome information exchange is frustrating their efforts to coordinate and improve patient care . A quarter-million — half of those eligible for the electronic health records program — will face fines in 2015 for failing to use the systems in the way the government required .
State Medicaid officials don ’ t know how many of their doctors are using electronic records , although they have handed out $ 9 billion of those federal funds to encourage their adoption . Nor do they have much sense of how much the technology is helping low-income patients .
All in all , while many believe digital health will eventually bring huge benefits , physicians have seen few of them to date .
Now , as the government begins cutting payments to those who have failed to demonstrate “ meaningful use ” of the electronic health records Washington began subsidizing four years ago , physician groups are fighting mad . And Congress wants to know why an industry with three freshly minted billionaires isn ’ t making better software .
2015 promises to be a critical year for determining whether electronic health records will enable physicians to communicate with each other efficiently to create better care . If they can ’ t get their systems to interact , the program may be seen as largely a waste .
Since 2011 , U.S. doctors and hospitals have had to show they were using electronic records to do things like prescribing and ordering tests , getting patients to download information , and to prove they were asking patients questions about things like smoking and blood pressure control .
When the subsidy program was announced as part of the federal stimulus , 12 percent of doctors had computerized records . Now , 60 percent of doctors and nearly all hospitals do . That ’ s a major commitment , and no one wants to go back to paper . But it ’ s a two-edged sword .
Those who see Medicare patients can earn up to $ 43,720 in federal payments for demonstrating “ meaningful use ” of their computers , but eventually they face penalties of as much as 5 percent of their Medicare payments for failing to meet the program ’ s requirements .
The first year of penalties starts in January ; more than 250,000 doctors will have 1 percent of their Medicare payments docked .
Members of Congress who track health IT are convinced the program is on the wrong track , according to House Energy and Commerce Committee staff . They aren ’ t entirely sure how to fix it , but 30 House members , including two Democrats , have co-sponsored a bill that would keep more doctors from being penalized by Medicare .
The fines are a bitter pill for doctors , who are spending an average of nearly an extra hour a day typing information into their computers because of the new rules . That means lost time with patients , and less income .
Rather than saving physicians and health care money , the program in effect has created a new industry — the medical scribe . About 100,000 of these glorified typists are expected to be working for doctors by 2020 .
“ After five years I can ’ t really do anything I couldn ’ t do before the program started , ” says Martin O ’ Hara , a cardiologist who practices in northern Virginia . Computers make everything more legible , O ’ Hara says , but otherwise the payoff has been slim .
At one hospital in the D.C. area , administrators were pulling their hair out over the huge fees charged to transmit data including routine lab and radiology tests . “ I talk to EHR vendors all day long and many of them have these criminal-like practices of setting whatever price tag they want because they can , ” said a medical informatics officer who spoke on condition he not be named .
Recently an EHR vendor charged the hospital $ 50,000 just to pull information from the computers of 20 affiliated physician practices and send it to the Department of Health and Human Services . The hospital had no choice but to pay , because HHS would withhold certain Medicare payments without the data .
EHR vendors promise they are working to improve the flow of data between medical offices and hospitals . But these blocked exchanges have attracted the attention of the Federal Trade Commission , and Congress put language in the spending bill President Barack Obama signed Dec. 16 that requires HHS ’ Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT to investigate why records aren ’ t flowing smoothly — and to decertify software that blocks such transactions .
Free data flows were a prime objective of the federal health IT push . The idea was that computers would make it easy for , say , a doctor to learn that his diabetic patient had been hospitalized . He could make sure she went home with the right drugs and a home nurse , so she didn ’ t end up back in an ER a week later after falling during a blood sugar-related bout of dizziness . And if she had other specialists , perhaps affiliated with different hospitals , they could follow her progress and communicate with each other too .
The idea is to both help the individual patient have better coordinated care , and to save the health care system money . If the records of 10,000 such diabetics flowed into databases used by researchers , went the thinking , they could more easily figure out the best drugs and treatments and make health care safer , cheaper and more effective .
The slow progress of health IT has also put a drag on research . Multiple sclerosis patients trying to set up a database leading to cures for their disease “ run into a brick wall ” trying to get information out of their electronic health records , says Marcia Kean , a consultant who works with one MS group .
Many of these patients see multiple doctors , each of whom has a different policy or capacity for sharing data . It ’ s not easy to obtain a record that makes sense to either the patient or a researcher , Kean said .
Optimists think an $ 11 billion contract to rewire the military ’ s electronic health records system could give software vendors the kick in the pants needed to get the country ’ s systems talking to each other .
The military , which wants the medical records of its active-duty soldiers to move smoothly to the Department of Veterans Affairs when they retire , has said it will pay only for a computer system that openly talks with others .
The major health IT giants , including Epic and Cerner , both run by Fortune 400 billionaires , have been vying for the contract by talking up their ability to exchange information .
Epic , a privately held company that holds the medical records of about half of Americans , has often been accused of failing to provide cheap or easy ways to connect with doctors or hospitals that don ’ t use its software . But now Epic and other vendors have joined alliances promising to improve information exchange .
“ Whether these are real or just shiny keys — time will tell , ” said Joel White , CEO of the tech-promoting advocacy group Health IT Now .
HHS is weighing whether to require vendors to equip their health records software with a single programming interface , like what Apple uses to allow app makers to smoothly and freely plug into its computers .
Meanwhile , as Congress focuses on data exchange , researchers say there are lingering problems with the usability of computers — and , potentially , their safety .
Doctors have to multitask much more of the time after switching to computerized systems . That explains why they feel more stress , says Raj Ratwani , scientific director of the National Center for Human Factors in Healthcare in Washington .
Studies suggest that electronic systems do make health care safer overall — for example , by replacing doctors ’ chicken scratch with electronic prescribing , and alerting them to dangerous drug combinations . Yet computers are introducing their own risks due to the strain they put on doctors ’ brains .
Most health record vendors didn ’ t pay enough attention to medical workflows when they designed the current generation of software . Better designs are coming down the pike , Ratwani says , but hospitals that spent hundreds of millions to install a software system can ’ t quickly switch to a new one .
Jon White , the deputy National Coordinator for Health IT ( and no relation to Joel White ) , sees hopeful little signs in the health care system .
Several days ago , his 13-year-old daughter broke a finger playing tag . She had it X-rayed , and by the time she reached the orthopedist ’ s office a half an hour later , the radiologist had already transmitted the image . It was hanging on the wall of the exam room .
“ It made me so happy the orthopod could look at the results so quickly , ” White said . “ That wouldn ’ t have been possible five years ago . ”
