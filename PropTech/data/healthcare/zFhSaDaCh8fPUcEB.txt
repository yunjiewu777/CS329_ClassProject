President Obama is saying he 's willing to negotiate changes to his signature health care law , ObamaCare , but won ’ t until Congress resolves its budget issues -- reaching a spending deal to reopen the government and raising the debt ceiling .
Obama has said before that he ’ s open to improving the law and would negotiate on anything when it comes to a bigger deal , or a so-called `` grand bargain . '' However , his remarks , as part of a wide-ranging interview with the Associated Press , come amid increasing pressure to make changes to ObamaCare .
A small-but-powerful group of conservative House Republicans forced the chamber 's leadership to make changes to ObamaCare part of negotiations on a temporary spending bill . And the failed negotiations resulted in a partial government shutdown that began Tuesday .
In addition , open enrollment for ObamaCare , which began the same day , was marred by widespread computer problems for Americans trying to buy insurance on government-run websites .
Obama told the wire service there 's a majority of lawmakers in the Republican-led House who would vote to end the partial government shutdown and raise the credit limit without conditions .
In the wide-ranging interview , the president also said he does n't expect Congress to breach the deadline to increase the nation 's borrowing limit , with that debate coming later this month .
The government is expected to hits its $ 16.7 trillion debt ceiling in mid-October .
Failure to raise that limit could lead to a first-ever default . Republicans want cuts in federal benefit programs and future deficits in exchange for their votes .
Obama also said U.S. intelligence assessments show Iran is still `` a year or more away '' from building a nuclear weapon , during the interview conducted Friday and released Saturday .
His assessment puts him at odds with Israel , which says Iran is just months away from being able to build a bomb . He acknowledged that Americans ’ estimates are `` more conservative '' than those of the Israelis .
Obama also said Americans are poorly served by first-term senators who seek controversy to boost their own profiles .
`` I recognize that in today 's media age , being controversial , taking controversial positions , rallying the most extreme parts of your base , whether it 's left or right , is a lot of times the fastest way to get attention and raise money , '' he said .
Obama sought to distance himself from first-term senators such as Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas , Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida . All three have become quick celebrities in the Senate , channeling the tea party 's anger toward Obama and raising their own status as potential White House contenders .
The president also said that if he owned the Washington Redskins , he would `` think about changing '' the team name , wading into the controversy over a football nickname that many people deem offensive to Native Americans .
Obama said team names like the Redskins offend `` a sizable group of people . '' He said that while fans get attached to the nicknames , nostalgia may not be a good enough reason to keep them in place .
`` I do n't know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real legitimate concerns that people have about these things , '' he said .
