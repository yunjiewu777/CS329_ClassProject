House Republicans voted Thursday to pass the American Health Care Act – their answer to ObamaCare .
The bill has gone through some changes since an earlier version was pulled from the floor in March in the face of flagging support .
-Ends tax penalties , under the original Affordable Care Act , for individuals who don ’ t buy insurance coverage and larger employers who don ’ t offer coverage . Instead , insurers would apply a 30 percent surcharge to customers who 've let coverage lapse for more than 63 days in the past year .
-Ends tax increases on higher-earning people and a range of industry groups including insurers , drug makers and medical device manufacturers .
-Cuts the Medicaid program for low-income people and lets states impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients . Forbids states that have n't already expanded Medicaid to do so . Changes Medicaid from an open-ended program that covers beneficiaries ' costs to one that gives states fixed amounts of money annually .
-Overhauls insurance subsidy system from one based largely on incomes and premium costs to a system of tax credits . The credits would rise with customers ’ ages and , like the subsidies , could be used toward premium costs .
-Lets states get federal waivers allowing insurers to charge older customers higher premiums than younger ones by as much as they 'd like . Obama 's law limits the difference to a 3-1 ratio . States also can get waivers exempting insurers from providing consumers with required coverage of specified health services , and from Obama 's prohibition against insurers charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing health problems , but only if the person has had a gap in insurance coverage .
-States could only get the latter waivers if they have mechanisms like high-risk pools that are supposed to help cover people with serious , expensive-to-treat diseases . A newly added provision would give another $ 8 billion over five years to help states finance their high-risk pools . Despite criticism that the waivers strip protections , House Speaker Paul Ryan ’ s office maintains that since states that take the waivers would have to set up the high-risk pools , “ insurance companies can not deny you coverage based on pre-existing conditions . ”
-Retains requirement that family policies cover grown children to age 26 .
