House Speaker John Boehner , in an abrupt turnaround , plans to let Tea Party lawmakers have a vote on de-funding ObamaCare as part of a politically risky strategy which Democrats warn could result in a government shutdown .
GOP leaders unveiled their plan to members on Wednesday morning , teeing up a vote for Friday -- the proposed bill would tie the vote to de-fund the health care law to a vote on a stopgap spending bill . Current funding for the government is set to expire at the end of the month , and lawmakers must approve the stopgap bill in order to keep Washington open ; conservatives see this as leverage to force a suspension of ObamaCare .
`` The law 's a trainwreck , '' Boehner said of the Affordable Care Act . `` It 's time to protect American families from this unworkable law . ''
Effectively , Boehner and his deputies have backed off a compromise approach they earlier tried to sell to rank-and-file conservatives . Under that plan , the House would have sent two bills to the Senate -- one to de-fund ObamaCare , the other to fund the government . The Senate , then , would have been able to easily bypass the ObamaCare bill and send the spending measure straight to the White House , in turn averting a government shutdown .
But House conservatives revolted , and Boehner now plans to tie the two votes together . Under the plan , funding the government would be conditional on de-funding ObamaCare . It is a concession to House conservatives as well as senators like Ted Cruz , R-Texas , and outside groups like the Heritage Foundation that have demanded Congress use the must-pass budget bill as leverage to derail the health care law .
President Obama and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid have warned Republicans not to go down that road , suggesting that they will bear the brunt of the blame if the gambit results in a government shutdown .
`` We 're hearing that a certain faction of Republicans , in the House of Representatives in particular are arguing for government shutdown or even a default for the United States of America ... if they do n't get 100 percent of what they want , '' Obama said .
On Wednesday in Washington , Obama suggested that Republicans have gotten distracted from their original goal of cutting deficits . `` We have not seen this in the past , that a budget is contingent on us eliminating a program that was voted on , passed by both chambers of Congress , '' Obama said .
The GOP measure would fund the government through Dec. 15 , at current funding levels . Republicans also plan to push a measure dealing with the debt ceiling , with a mid-October deadline looming for when the government can no longer honor its obligations . GOP leaders say that measure will include an effort to delay the implementation of the health care law as well .
Democratic leaders have no intention , though , of supporting any effort to de-fund the health law , and the Senate would likely reject such a move and send the measure back .
Then it would be an open question as to whether the House could pass a straight budget bill . Boehner might be compelled to consider passing a budget with a coalition of mostly Democrats . Or , the House and Senate could get stuck in a bout of legislative ping-pong , each passing its own bill and bouncing it over to the other chamber .
But that could only last so long , since government funding runs out at midnight on Sept. 30 . The bill would become a hot potato -- neither chamber would want to have it when the clock runs out .
`` When it comes to a government shutdown , it may depend on who is holding the ball at the end , '' said Rep. Steve Southerland , R-Fla .
