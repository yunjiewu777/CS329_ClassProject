The Supreme Court gave President Obama a reason to be giddy about the status of his signature health care legislation on Friday , upholding Obamacare subsidies for individuals living in states without state based Obamacare exchanges . He promptly held a presser at the White House , beaming that the Affordable Care Act was “ here to stay. ” Now , it appears he ’ s taking his victory tour to Tennessee .
Rep. Diane Black ( R-TN ) , a former nurse , suggested that maybe the president should have done a little research before choosing her state to promote his pride and joy .
“ During his visit to Tennessee , perhaps President Obama will explain why Obamacare customers in our state have been told to expect a 36 percent premium increase next year , despite the President ’ s promise that his law would save families an average of $ 2,500 per year . Or maybe he will address the 28,000 Tennesseans who lost their insurance coverage in a single day despite his pledge that ‘ If you like your health care plan , you can keep it. ’ Whatever the case , the President has picked the wrong location to take a victory lap on the Supreme Court ’ s irresponsible ruling and my conservative colleagues and I will not relent in the fight to fully repeal Obamacare . ”
The ACA 's trail of destruction doesn ’ t end there . A nationwide CNN poll revealed that twice as many Americans were hurt by Obamacare than benefited from it .
The pinch was especially felt in Tennessee , where state-sponsored insurance programs , which thousands of residents relied on , were effectively shut down thanks to ACA . Here ’ s how families found out :
Letters are going out this week to explain the changes to people covered by AccessTN , a program for people who have pre-existing medical conditions , and by CoverRX , a prescription benefits program . The 16,000 people enrolled in CoverTN , a limited benefits plan , have already been notified it will end Dec. 31 . Many families also have received notice they will no longer be able to buy into CoverKids .
No wonder why Rep. Black is sending a message to President Obama that no speech can put a Band Aid on what these families endured .
