After intense backlash , the University of Texas 's Young Conservatives student group called off their controversial `` catch an illegal immigrant '' event today .
In a statement , the YCT chairman and event 's organizer Lorenzo Garcia acknowledged that staging a mock hunt for illegal immigrants on campus and offering $ 25 rewards was `` misguided '' and `` intentionally over the top . ''
`` I spoke with our chapter 's members , and they are both concerned that the university will retaliate against them and that the protest against the event could create a safety issue for our volunteers , '' Garcia said .
The Facebook group for the event , which was scheduled to take place on Wednesday has been deleted , but up until this morning , it was filled with negative reactions from fellow students to the event .
Gregory J. Vincent , the university 's VP of Diversity and Community Engagement , denounced it as `` provocative '' and `` contributing to the degradation of our campus culture . ''
In a separate statement today , the University of Texas system Board of Regents Chairman Paul L. Foster and Chancellor Francisco G. Cigarroa issued a scathing denunciation of the group 's plans .
`` It is both disappointing and dishonorable for any UT student to treat another with disrespect , and we hope that the Young Conservatives of Texas explore more constructive and mature ways to promote a dialogue about issues of concern to them , '' they said .
The university welcomed the event 's cancellation in a subsequent statement .
Even while Garcia announced that he would cancel the event , he said that he was `` shocked '' by the uproar over the `` event 's premise '' and the personal attacks he has received as a result .
`` I have been called an 'Uncle Tom . ' I have received emails and comments via social media filled with obscenity , '' Garcia continued . `` The reactions of some who claim that YCT is creating a demeaning or degrading environment on campus have been truly disgraceful . ''
