The finger-pointing was in full swing Thursday at a tense Capitol Hill hearing where the contractors behind the botched ObamaCare website defended their work and claimed the government failed to properly test the system before launch .
The contractors faced tough questioning from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle , who voiced frustration with the weeks-long problems surrounding the federal hub . Lawmakers cast doubt on attempts by contractors , who were paid millions , to claim they were not responsible for many of the site 's problems . Top contractor CGI Federal revealed it was paid $ 290 million in taxpayer funds .
But CGI Federal and other contractors repeatedly claimed that overall `` end-to-end '' testing was the responsibility of an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services , as was the decision to go live on Oct. 1 .
They suggested more time was needed to work out the -- major -- kinks .
Representing contractor QSSI , Andrew Slavitt told the committee that ideally , end-to-end testing should have occurred well before the launch , with enough time to correct flaws .
`` We would have loved to have months , '' concurred CGI vice president Cheryl Campbell , though she earlier claimed no amount of testing could have flagged all the problems .
Questioned whether there were concerns the site was not ready to go live , she also said : `` It was not our position to tell our client whether they should go live or not go live . ''
Slavitt said his firm did share concerns with the agency , Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , adding they were responsible for addressing them .
`` We identified errors in code that was provided to us by others , '' he said . `` In this function we reported back the results to CMS and the relevant contractor , who in turn was responsible for fixing coding errors or making any necessary changes . ''
He also blamed in part a `` late decision '' to require customers to register before browsing for insurance , which could have helped overwhelm the registration system .
`` This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that would n't have otherwise occurred if consumers could window-shop anonymously , '' he said .
CMS officials , in a conference call later in the day , acknowledged that there should have been more testing , but said there was n't due to the `` compressed '' timeframe . They also claimed responsibility for the decision to make people fully log on before browsing for insurance .
The hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee was the first of what is likely to be many on the failures of the main ObamaCare website . Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , who skipped Thursday 's hearing for an event in Phoenix , is expected to testify next Wednesday .
While Sebelius will face tough questioning , lawmakers on Thursday also took issue with much of the contractors ' testimony , as they assigned blame to CMS and each other .
Rep. Anna Eshoo , D-Calif. , questioned their claims that `` unexpected volumes '' of traffic caused much of the trouble .
`` I think it 's really kind of a lame excuse , '' she said . `` Amazon and eBay do n't crash the week before Christmas and ProFlowers does n't crash on Valentine 's Day . ''
The witnesses at times downplayed the problems with the site itself , prompting jeers from lawmakers .
`` The system is working . People are enrolling , '' Campbell testified , acknowledging the system is still too slow .
Noting that the administration is urging people to use paper applications , Rep. Joe Barton , R-Texas , said : `` That is a system that has failed . ''
Campbell -- who said she still thinks everything will be fixed in time for the Jan. 1 hard launch -- and others acknowledged the system needs to be improved . But all four contractor representatives tried to spread the blame around for the problems to date . Representatives from Equifax Workforce Solutions and Serco also spoke .
Campbell said QSSI 's tool that allowed consumers to create secure accounts created a `` bottleneck '' in the system .
Slavitt later said QSSI takes `` accountability '' for the problems with that function .
Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle took aim Thursday at the contractors , even as they implicated administration officials . Lawmakers were indignant as they complained that officials looked them in the eye before Oct. 1 and told them the launch of HealthCare.gov was on track .
`` Either these officials were shockingly unaware of what was happening ... or deliberately misleading our committee and the public , '' Rep. Tim Murphy , R-Pa. , said .
`` They said there was nothing wrong , and they expressed nothing but optimism , '' Rep. Diana DeGette , D-Colo. , said .
Republicans , still committed to repealing Obama 's health care law , approached the questioning with a prosecutorial tone , leading New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone to call the whole exercise a `` monkey court . ''
An official with the Department of Health and Human Services plans to brief House Republicans on the site on Oct. 30 .
