President Trump signed an order Wednesday ending the separation of families at the border , moving to end a crisis that engulfed his administration and threatened to derail his hopes of progress on broader immigration reforms .
The changes don ’ t end the new zero-tolerance policy that pushes for criminal prosecutions of illegal immigrants who jump the border — indeed , it enshrines the policy in the executive order .
But it does mean those families arrested for sneaking in will be held in immigration detention facilities , rather than separated , with parents sent to criminal justice system jails and kids handed off to Health Department-run dorms .
“ What we have done today is we are keeping families together . The borders are just as tough , just as strong , ” Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office as he signed the order , flanked by Vice President Mike Pence and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen .
It ’ s not clear what the order means for the more than 2,300 children who were already separated . The government has been unable to say how many of them were already reunited , and couldn ’ t say Wednesday what will happen now in those cases .
And much of the success of the order depends on being able to hold families in detention longer than 20 days — which will require overturning a 2015 court case that imposed the 20-day limit . Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ask the court to revise its ruling , and he urged Congress to step in and pass legislation to solve the matter once and for all .
“ This is a stopgap measure . The president ’ s doing everything he can here within the bounds of existing authority , ” said Gene Hamilton , a senior aide to Mr . Sessions .
But immigrant-rights groups were furious , saying that while they didn ’ t want children separated from families , neither did they want families to be detained .
“ Family incarceration is not the answer to ending family separation , and moving children from one cage to another is an outrage , ” said Neera Tanden , president of the Center for American Progress , a leading liberal think tank .
Indeed , Mr. Trump ’ s decision Wednesday seemed to rip the bandaid off the immigration fight , exposing the scabs of years of stalemate .
On one side was the administration and many Republicans , who argued that people who come to the country illegally should be quickly deported , and the only way to ensure that is to hold them in detention , which makes sure they show up for their hearings .
Opposing Mr. Trump are Democrats and immigrant-rights groups that argue many of the illegal immigrants should be treated as refugees , should not be held in detention , and should be given government-funded lawyers to help them argue their cases for why they should be allowed to stay .
Signing the order marked a major retreat for the president , who for the last week had blamed Democrats for the separations and said it would take a change in law to stop it .
On Wednesday , Mr. Trump talked about the “ dilemma ” he felt he was facing .
“ The dilemma is that if you ’ re weak — like some people would like you to be — if you ’ re really , really pathetically weak , the country ’ s going to be overrun with millions of people , ” Mr. Trump said . “ And if you ’ re strong , then you don ’ t have any heart . That ’ s a tough dilemma . Perhaps I ’ d rather be strong , but that ’ s a tough dilemma . ”
The crux of the zero-tolerance policy is using the criminal code to try to deter illegal immigration . For decades , it ’ s been a crime to jump the border — though past administrations used those provisions only sparingly .
The Trump administration has said it wants nearly 100 percent prosecutions .
Currently those charged with crimes are supposed to be held by the Justice Department , whose jails are not equipped for family custody . Homeland Security does have some family detention facilities , but they are used for people in the immigration system , not the criminal justice system .
House Republicans ’ new immigration bill , expected to be voted on Thursday , includes a provision that would write into law the ability for the government to keep migrants in criminal proceedings in Homeland Security facilities .
The House bill would only apply to parents charged with misdemeanors . Those with felony charges , such as smuggling or reentering the country after a previous deportation , would still go to the Justice Department under the House plan .
Keeping families together in Homeland Security detention will likely require an infusion of cash to create more family detention space .
Mr. Trump ordered the Defense Department and other federal agencies to offer whatever space they could .
The Obama administration , which faced its own surge of illegal immigrant families in 2014 and 2015 , tried to open family detention centers but was met with fierce opposition by immigrant-rights advocates who said it was cruel to keep families detained .
“ Even if families are detained together , it is just as harmful as family separation , ” said America ’ s Voice , a leading advocacy group , citing psychologists .
The number of families surging toward the U.S. has increased dramatically this year . Activist groups say they ’ re fleeing horrific conditions back home , while Mr. Trump says they ’ re being enticed to the U.S. by “ loopholes ” and other lax policies , realizing that if they can show up with children they ’ ll be quickly released and can disappear into the shadows with the 11 million other illegal immigrants already here .
That spurred the zero-tolerance policy , which kicked in fully in early May .
Homeland Security officials said that from May 5 through June 9 they arrested 4,538 people who snuck into the U.S. traveling as families and who faced separation . That included 2,206 adults who were prosecuted and sent to jail to await their proceedings , leaving 2,342 juveniles as Unaccompanied Alien Children who had to be stuck in government-run dorms .
Usually the adults serve a few days in jail , plead guilty to illegal entry charges , are sentenced to the time they already served , and are released back into the immigration system .
Senate Republicans on Wednesday introduced a bill that would try to permanently stop family separations by allowing them to be kept together in Homeland Security facilities for a longer period of time . The legislation would set mandatory conditions for the family detention centers , and it would also try to shorten the time immigration cases take by adding more judges and giving priority to these cases .
The GOP bill , combined with Mr. Trump ’ s move , puts the focus back on Democrats .
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said Mr. Trump made the right move — and said he hoped the administration would move quickly to reunite the more than 2,000 children already taken from parents .
But his top lieutenant , Sen. Dick Durbin , blasted Mr. Trump and demanded he end detention altogether for the families in question .
“ Locking up whole families is no solution at all — the Trump administration must reverse its policy of prosecuting vulnerable people fleeing three of the most dangerous countries on earth , who are attempting to seek safe haven in America , ” the Illinois Democrat said .
