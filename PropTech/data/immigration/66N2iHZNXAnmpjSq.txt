President Trump on Monday said he would not sign a bill that would result in the “ mass release ” of criminals into the U.S. , potentially complicating the new deal negotiators announced on Capitol Hill .
Mr. Trump said he hadn ’ t heard full details , but said he would also build his border wall no matter what the deal included .
“ We ’ re building the wall anyway , ” the president said at a rally in El Paso , Texas .
He told cheering supporters he ’ d been told about the deal just before taking the stage at the rally , but he told aides he would wait to hear details later , saying he didn ’ t want to keep supporters waiting .
“ I will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of violent criminals into our country , ” he said .

That was a response to Democrats ‘ proposal over the weekend to limit the number of illegal immigrants detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to just 34,000 , with only 16,500 of them coming from ICE ’ s own interior arrests . The rest would come from the border .
Democrats appeared to have backed off that strict limit , according to reports about the deal .
Instead , negotiators agreed to an average daily ICE detention population of slightly more than 40,000 .
Still , given that ICE has averaged nearly 46,000 a day for the first four months of the fiscal year , that likely would mean the agency will have to cut its levels to between 34,000 and 36,000 for the rest of this year in order to meet the new restrictions .
Whether that would result in the mass releases Mr. Trump warned against was unclear , though his rhetoric seemed skeptical .
“ If we cut detention space we are cutting loose dangerous criminals , ” he said in Texas .
