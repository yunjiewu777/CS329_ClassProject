        "topic": "Saving DREAMers is only this hard because Donald Trump has made it this hard",
        "date": "2018-02-14",
        "content": "This week , the Senate is debating a solution for DREAMers . Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , making good on his word , brought an empty bill to the floor , permitting both sides to try to round up 60 votes to fill in the text . Inauspiciously , the first day was consumed by a disagreement on where to start . McConnell wanted to begin with a vote on banning sanctuary cities . Chuck Schumer , speaking for the Democrats , demanded the Senate start with President Trump \u2019 s proposal . The dispute was particularly confusing because neither starting point has a remote hope of passage . An argument over which idea to reject first is very Senate 2018 .\nBut it \u2019 s worth zooming out . The public conversation around the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program has gotten confused , with everyone agreeing to pretend , for various self-interested reasons , that President Trump actually wants a DACA solution , and fast . Trump and the Republicans have adopted this posture because DREAMers are wildly popular \u2014 giving DREAMers legal status is about twice as popular as Trump himself . Meanwhile , Democrats have agreed to Trump \u2019 s framing of his position because they think it helps pressure Trump into a deal .\nNegotiations on DACA have begun . Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal . Wouldn \u2019 t it be great if we could finally , after so many years , solve the DACA puzzle . This will be our last chance , there will never be another opportunity ! March 5th . \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 13 , 2018\nThere is a deep strangeness to this rhetoric . Trump created a crisis for DREAMers \u2014 all this began when he unilaterally decided to end the DACA program \u2014 and then refused the obvious compromises that could have fixed it . Now he is threatening a veto of the likeliest bipartisan compromises in the Senate . He has taken 690,000 hostages and is now trumpeting the wonderful opportunity everyone has to pay his policy ransom in order to free them , and he is doing all of it while insisting he desperately wants to free them too .\nThe truth is , Trump doesn \u2019 t want a DACA solution . He is willing to accept a DACA solution in return for other things he wants \u2014 notably , heavy investments in border security and a large cut in legal immigration \u2014 but within the negotiations , a DACA fix is the thing Trump is treating as a concession on his part , not the thing he is trying to make happen . If it were the thing he was trying to make happen , it would have happened already .\nRight now , the fate of the DREAMers doesn \u2019 t depend mainly on Democrats . It depends on Republicans . If McConnell and Paul Ryan want a deal , they could have one in moments . If Trump wants to save DREAMers , he could do so , and get money for his wall and other border enforcement and immigration changes , tomorrow . But what he actually wants is a suite of restrictionist changes to immigration that are noxious not just to Democrats , but to DREAMers themselves , and he is trying to hide that unpopular agenda behind pro-DREAMer rhetoric , even as he \u2019 s holding DREAMers hostage to pass it .\nThis shell game works until it doesn \u2019 t . If there \u2019 s no deal , and the Trump administration begins deporting DREAMers over Democratic objections , his real position will become very clear , very quickly .\nIf the Senate passes a DREAMer deal , will the House vote on it ?\nWhich bring us back to Congress . My conversations with both Democratic and Republican staffers , both inside and outside of leadership , have ended in unanimous shrugs . No one knows what , if anything , can actually pass the Senate . And the difficulty of that question pales in comparison to the difficulty of what , if anything , can pass the House . Ryan has said he will not bring a bill to the floor that doesn \u2019 t have Trump \u2019 s blessing , and so it is entirely possible that the Senate will pass a deal that never sees a House vote .\nIf that happens , Democrats have little recourse . They \u2019 re in the minority in both the House and the Senate , and after passing last week \u2019 s spending deal , they no longer have the threat of shutting down the government .\nThis is something I got wrong in my initial reaction to the shutdown deal . In preserving the option to shut the government down in the future , I argued , there was no real loss for Democrats , as they hadn \u2019 t abandoned any of their leverage . What I didn \u2019 t appreciate immediately was how much the shutdown had spooked Senate Democrats \u2014 after shutting down the government , they realized they had no strategy for winning the shutdown , and they certainly had no strategy for forcing Trump to fold amid the kind of high-stakes cable news showdown he lives for . So while the shutdown deal held open the option of a future shutdown , in fact , that option had closed , because Senate Democrats had lost faith in it . Now it \u2019 s gone entirely .\nOver the past week , I \u2019 ve been asking Senate Democrats what leverage they have on immigration given that they can no longer shut down the government . The answer , universally , is what leverage exists comes from the issue itself . DREAMers are popular , and deporting them is unpopular . But Donald Trump is the president of the United States , Mitch McConnell is the majority leader of the US Senate , and Paul Ryan is the speaker of the House . They control the process , and they control the outcome .",

        "content": "An eight-year-old boy from Guatemala has died in US government custody , officials say , the second migrant child to die in US detention this month .\nThe border agency says the boy died on Monday night hours after showing signs of illness . A Texas congressman named him as Felipe Al\u00f3nzo-Gomez .\nThe child was detained with his father on 18 December after illegally crossing the US-Mexico border .\nA seven-year-old girl died earlier this month just hours after being detained .\nJakelin Caal , also from Guatemala , developed a high fever and died of liver failure . Her funeral was held in her village on Tuesday .\nThousands of migrants have travelled from Central America - mainly from Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador - to the US border .\nMany say they are fleeing persecution , poverty and violence in their home countries and plan to seek asylum in the US .\nIn a new , lengthy statement , the US Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) said the boy , whose identity has not been officially confirmed , died at 23:48 local time ( 06:48 GMT ) on 24 December . The cause of death is still unknown .\nAfter being detained in El Paso , Texas , he and his father were taken to a local processing centre , where they spent two days . They were then sent to El Paso Border Patrol Station , where they were held for another two days .\nOn 22 December , they were transferred to Alamogordo Border Patrol Station , in neighbouring New Mexico .\nOn Monday morning , an agent noticed that the boy `` was coughing and appeared to have glossy eyes '' . He was taken with his father to a hospital where he was diagnosed with a common cold and given Tylenol ( paracetamol ) .\nWhile being evaluated for release , he was found to have a fever of 103F ( 39.4C ) and held for more observation . He was released shortly afterwards with a prescription for an antibiotic and ibuprofen .\nThe boy and his father were taken to a temporary site at the Highway 70 checkpoint , where the child received the medication . Two hours later , he vomited .\nHis father declined further medical assistance , the CBP said , as the child had been feeling better .\nThe child appeared lethargic at around 22:00 , when he was sent back to the hospital . While being transported , the boy vomited and lost consciousness , and doctors at the hospital were unable to revive him .\nThe CBP earlier said the boy died just after midnight . It did not explain why they were held for so long .\nHis father remains in custody . The Associated Press news agency reported they had plans to go to Johnson City , Tennessee .\nCBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said the death was `` tragic '' and announced that the agency would conduct further medical checks on all children in custody , with a focus on those under the age of 10 .\nHe also said the CBP would review its policies and work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) to improve custody conditions .\nHuman rights groups criticised the CBP and Guatemala 's foreign ministry called for an investigation .\nTexas Congressman Joaquin Castro called for a congressional investigation , saying the administration 's policy of turning people away at the border `` is putting families and children in great danger '' .\nThe Trump administration has tried to deter asylum seekers from crossing the border irregularly between ports of entry , warning that they could face arrest , prosecution and deportation .\nBut , at the same time , it is restricting access to those trying to cross through official ports of entry , creating a long wait for applicants .\nAmong them are thousands of Central American migrants who travelled together in so-called `` caravans '' , and arrived at the border with California in recent weeks .\nPresident Trump has vowed to keep each migrant on the Mexican side of the border until courts have decided their cases .",

        "topic": "Trump racks up wins in battle to contain surge at border",
        "date": "2019-07-28",
        "content": "President Trump is suddenly on a surprising winning streak when it comes to immigration .\nWith his border wall , where the Supreme Court has cleared the way to begin construction under his emergency declaration , and negotiations with Latin American neighbors , Mr. Trump in the past weeks has finally begun to make headway on a number of major items on his immigration checklist .\nThe court and foreign policy victories were coupled with some policy moves within the administration that could further constrain the surge of migrants , including guidance issued Friday telling asylum officers to make sure migrants are fleeing state-sanctioned violence before they are granted asylum .\n\u201c The Trump administration is trying to throw everything it can at this problem , \u201d said Jessica Vaughan , policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies .\nThe big moves last week included an agreement signed with Guatemala that will allow the U.S. to send any asylum-seekers who cross that country \u2019 s territory en route to the U.S. back to Guatemala to ask for asylum there instead .\nGiven Guatemala \u2019 s strategic geographic location \u2014 it lies on Mexico \u2019 s southern border , and land travelers must cross it during their journey north \u2014 the agreement could allow the U.S. to deny tens of thousands of asylum-seekers the chance to ask for status before they reach the border .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve long been working with Guatemala , and now we can do it the right way , \u201d Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office after signing the deal with Guatemalan Interior Minister Enrique Degenhart .\nHours later , the president received news of another win : The Supreme Court , in a 5-4 ruling , had cleared the way for him to use his emergency border declaration to use Pentagon money to build more of his wall .\nThe Republican-appointed justices ended a lower-court blockade of his budgeting moves , limits that a federal district judge in California and later an appeals court had imposed while the case was being argued on the merits .\nThe high court didn \u2019 t reveal its reasoning , but the ruling is a major victory at a crucial time .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s attorneys told the justices they were racing a Sept. 30 deadline . If they didn \u2019 t obligate the money by then , they would lose the chance to spend it on the wall .\nThe immediate effect of the ruling is to let the administration tap several billion dollars within the Pentagon \u2019 s budget and direct it toward building the wall , which was Mr. Trump \u2019 s most visible 2016 campaign promise .\nOpponents said they will continue to fight , including pressing lower courts to speed up the arguments on their broader challenge to the emergency declaration \u2019 s constitutionality .\n\u201c This is not over , \u201d said Dror Ladin , an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , said the Supreme Court ruling \u201c undermines the Constitution . \u201d\nMr. Trump expressed his enthusiasm in his unique system of uppercase letters on Twitter : \u201c Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law ! \u201d\nThe two victories for Mr. Trump last week follow on his success in June , when he used the threat of tariffs to force Mexico to the bargaining table . Mexico agreed to do more to head off migrants crossing its territory and to take back more Central American asylum-seekers , making them wait in Mexico while their cases proceed through the U.S. immigration courts .\nThe effects of the Mexico deal were already having some effect .\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan told \u201c Fox Business Sunday \u201d that the number of illegal immigrants nabbed at the U.S.-Mexico border fell 28 % in June and is down another 20 % in July .\nIn May , Customs and Border Protection encountered 4,650 unauthorized migrants a day . The number now is 2,600 , he said .\nThe emergency border spending bill that Mr. Trump won from Congress a month ago has also helped ease overcrowding at border facilities .\nAt its peak in early June , CBP had 19,000 people in custody . That number is now 7,200 , Mr. McAleenan said .\nOne of Mr. McAleenan \u2019 s top lieutenants took yet another step Friday to try to reduce the flow of migrants by ordering asylum officers to cast a dim eye on some asylum claims .\n\u201c Private violence \u201d doesn \u2019 t cut it , said Ken Cuccinelli , acting director of U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services . While conditions may be rough , he said , there just isn \u2019 t enough \u201c pervasive \u201d violence in El Salvador , Honduras and Guatemala to automatically grant asylum to people fleeing those countries .\nMr. Trump started winning immigration fights after he revamped his team , shuffling the leaders of the Homeland Security Department and each of the three agencies that handles immigration . The department and all three agencies are now headed by temporary officers .\nThe administration \u2019 s moves will continue to face scrutiny in the courts .\nSeveral activist groups have vowed to challenge the Guatemala asylum agreement . Critics said that country isn \u2019 t safe enough nor capable enough to provide asylum to others crossing its territory .\n\u201c Such an arrangement would make a mockery of the notion that those fleeing persecution in Central America have any recourse , \u201d said Eric Schwartz , president of Refugees International .\nMs. Vaughan , though , said the Guatemala agreement was proof that the U.S. does have leverage with foreign countries that previous administrations hadn \u2019 t used .\n\u201c What remains to be seen is which message comes through stronger in Central America ( and around the world now ) \u2014 do they hear that the risk of failure is much higher now because Trump and the other governments are cracking down , or do they hear that American judges are blocking his efforts ? \u201d she said .\nShe said the Trump administration must be prepared to fend off those legal challenges .\n\u201c Now that Trump has come to realize that Congress isn \u2019 t going to be much help , and that he needs to go at this problem from all angles , with every immigration agency involved , it looks like we are finally starting to see results , \u201d she said .",

        "content": "Fazliddin Kurbanov is from Uzbekistan , a Central Asian country that borders Afghanistan . This month , Mr. Kurbanov was arrested in Boise , Idaho , charged with teaching people how to build bombs that could be used to target public transportation . He is accused of conspiring with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , which the United States recognizes as a terrorist organization . Mr. Kurbanov was here legally , admitted as a refugee in 2009 .\nLast year , in Aurora , Colo. , Jamshid Muhtorov was arrested and charged with providing material support to the Islamic Jihad Union , which the United States recognizes as a terrorist organization . Like Mr. Kurbanov , Mr. Muhtorov is from Uzbekistan and was also here legally as a refugee .\nIn 2011 , in my hometown of Bowling Green , Ky. , Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi were arrested and accused of supporting efforts to kill American troops in Iraq . Both men are from Iraq . Both were also here legally as refugees .\nThe Bowling Green Daily News reported that these Iraqi refugees \u201c slipped through the vetting process that allowed both of them political asylum in the United States. \u201d Apparently , Mr. Kurbanov and Mr. Muhtorov \u201c slipped through \u201d as well .\nSo did Ulugbek Kodirov , who was arrested in Birmingham , Ala. , last year and sentenced to 15 years in prison for plotting to kill President Obama . Kodirov was from Uzbekistan and was in the country illegally on a student-visa overstay .\nLast month , two pressure-cooker bombs were exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon , killing three and injuring 264 people . The Washington Post noted of the suspects , brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev : \u201c With their baseball hats and sauntering gaits , they appeared to friends and neighbors like ordinary American boys . But the Boston bombing suspects were refugees from another world \u2014 the blood , rubble and dirty wars of the Russian Caucasus . \u201d\nI condemn government inefficiency and incompetence often . The targets for criticism are endless . In the repeating patterns from these refugee and visa cases , however , we see potentially dangerous scenarios in which we can not afford any excuses .\nIn the case of Sept. 11 , 2001 , if the State Department had more adequately monitored visa overstays and application screening , most of hijackers would have been detected and caught beforehand . After the Boston bombing , I asked what faults we might have in our current intelligence that allowed the Russian government to identify the suspects as potential terrorists before the US government did .\nThese questions are crucial as Congress continues to debate immigration reform , in which vital national security concerns must be addressed . Our visa and refugee programs deserve far more monitoring and scrutiny , and there is something desperately wrong with a \u201c vetting process \u201d that makes so many repeated mistakes .\nNot all countries are the same , and neither are refugees . The National Security Registration System created by Congress in 2002 was intended to give extra screening to those coming from countries with higher populations of extremists . Suspended in 2011 , to my knowledge , there has been no effort to replace it with similar screening . There \u2019 s really no excuse for this . We send men and women all over the world to fight terrorism and often seem unwilling to take the most common-sense precautions at home with our immigration policies . We know that the old system had its problems , but we also know that what we \u2019 re doing now isn \u2019 t working .\nIt is ironic that some of the things we call \u201c national security \u201d in our foreign policy actually have little to do with protecting the nation , while some of the simple things we don \u2019 t do in our immigration policy could better protect us . It \u2019 s time we did them .\nAfter the tragic attack in Boston , I sent the following in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid :\n\u201c I respectfully request that the Senate consider the following two conditions as part of the comprehensive immigration-reform debate : One , the Senate needs a thorough examination of the facts in Massachusetts to see if legislation is necessary to prevent a similar situation in the future . Two , national security protections must be rolled into comprehensive immigration reform to make sure the federal government does everything it can to prevent immigrants with malicious intent from using our immigration system to gain entry into the United States in order to commit future acts of terror . \u201d\nMy proposed amendments to immigration-reform legislation seek to correct flaws in our current system , and these weaknesses must be addressed before any genuine reform can happen .\nThey must also be addressed before another attack or tragedy happens \u2014 and it is our job in Congress to address them .\nSen. Rand Paul , Kentucky Republican , is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security committees .",

        "content": "Assaults on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents reached a decade high in 2017 , and assaults on Border Patrol agents also have surged in recent years , according to government numbers that seem to support agents \u2019 claims that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally increasingly are looking to fight rather than flee .\nThe new numbers , reported by Homeland Security \u2019 s inspector general , could even be underselling the problem , investigators said , because the government doesn \u2019 t do a good job of tracking incidents , and agents and officers don \u2019 t always report them properly .\nBut the report does signal renewed danger particularly on the southwest border , where agents say a surge in illegal immigration in recent years generally correlates with growing violence .\nProsecutors , meanwhile , often refuse to bring charges or win cases against the perpetrators , the audit found .\nAt the border , the most frequent method of attack was projectiles \u2014 usually large rocks \u2014 which accounted for half of assaults . But bombs , clubs , knives , guns and even laser pointers to blind agents have all been used .\nMost of the injuries were minor and didn \u2019 t require treatment , the audit found .\nCustoms and Border Protection recorded 1,089 assaults in 2010 , which steadily dropped through 2014 , when there were just 381 assaults . But things turned violent once again , steadily rising to 856 assaults in 2017 .\nLast year was the most violent this decade at the border , with 28 assaults per every 10,000 apprehensions .\nIn the interior , meanwhile , ICE agents and officers saw 48 assaults in 2017 , tying 2010 as the highest in records going back to the beginning of the decade .\nICE officers , who handle deportations , and Border Patrol agents , who patrol the line between the U.S. and Mexico , say they \u2019 ve seen an increasing willingness on the part of migrants to resort to violence in recent years .\nOne of those assaults recorded in 2017 came when ICE officers tried to apprehend Lester Sadict Cruz-Garcia , an immigrant from Honduras who was arrested by police in New York on a domestic assault charge . Police released him into the community , ignoring a request by ICE that he be held .\nDeportation officers then had to go out into the community to track him down at his home . When they approached him , he struggled and kicked , attempting the get away , the officers said .\nThey eventually got him in handcuffs and tried to get him into the back of an ICE vehicle when he bit one of the officers on the arm . The officer was taken to a hospital , where he was prescribed antibiotics .\nCruz-Garcia was sentenced in June to 364 days in jail .\nIn another incident last year , ICE officers in Massachusetts were trying to deport Mohammed Kenneh to Liberia . They drove him to Logan International Airport in Boston , but he knocked one officer to the ground and then used the handcuffs around his wrists to ensnare the officer \u2019 s hand , refusing to let go .\nThe officer had to be taken to the emergency room .",

        "content": "Law enforcement in San Francisco will no longer be cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement , per a directive by San Francisco \u2019 s newly elected sheriff .\nPaul Miyamoto , who was elected to be the top law enforcer in San Francisco in November 2019 , declared to a local media outlet Tuesday that his department will not help with federal immigration enforcement . While San Francisco has long opposed most cooperation with ICE , the announcement further cements the progressive city \u2019 s status as a sanctuary jurisdiction .\n\u201c Our department is not involved in immigration enforcement , \u201d Miyamoto , the first Asian American sheriff of San Francisco , told KTVU Fox 2 . \u201c We feel that is a federal matter , and our realm of interest is public safety , and you can \u2019 t really have a safe community if the community members are afraid to come to us to report crimes . \u201d\nNamely , his department will not honor immigration detainers lodged by federal agents . If an illegal alien in San Francisco is placed into local custody for an unrelated crime , and ICE asks that the individual be transferred into the agency \u2019 s custody , that request will simply be ignored .\nMiyamoto argues that the policy promotes public safety , despite that there are many documented cases of illegal aliens committing additional crimes after they have been released from local custody .\nThe directive appears somewhat redundant given that authorities all across California have already been greatly prohibited in how they can work with ICE . Having been in effect since January 2018 , the California Values Act bars state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests , making it impossible for illegal aliens to be directly transferred into the agency \u2019 s custody .\nWhile giving his latest State of the Union address earlier in February , President Donald Trump specifically highlighted California as an example of the dangers of sanctuary policy . The president invited as his guest the brother of a man who was killed by an illegal alien . That particular alien had been arrested by local authorities and had an ICE detainer placed on him , but because of the California Values Act law , he was released back into the public .\nThe Trump administration took its opposition to California \u2019 s sanctuary policies a monumental step farther this month when the Department of Justice announced a complaint against a state law that prohibits the operation of private detention facilities . Attorney General William Barr said at the time that the law was intended to forbid the detention of aliens in the state .\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed , a Democrat , declared that the city was being unfairly targeted by the Trump administration , but she remained adamant about the city \u2019 s protection of illegal aliens . ( RELATED : \u2018 Endangers The Lives Of The Public \u2019 : Trump Goes On Rant About Los Angeles Mayor )\n\u201c We \u2019 re being targeted on so many levels , \u201d Breed said . \u201c But , the fact is we \u2019 re a strong city , we \u2019 re a resilient city and we will fight against those attacks and we will protect the people of this city . \u201d",

        "content": "The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee introduced amendments Tuesday to grant gay couples the same immigration rights as other married couples , setting up a key hurdle for the immigration bill .\nAmendments were due Tuesday if they were to be part of the debate that begins Thursday in the Judiciary Committee . The dozens of changes filed by senators signal a bloody fight ahead as some Democrats seek to make the bill more generous , some Republicans seek a deeper crackdown , and the legislation \u2019 s sponsors try to hold a tenuous center .\nSen. Jeff Sessions , an Alabama Republican who has taken the lead in fighting to stop the bill , introduced 49 amendments , including limiting the overall level of legal immigration allowed under the bill , or requiring the full 700 miles of reinforced fencing Congress called for back in 2006 , but which was only partially built .\nAnd Sen. Chuck Grassley , the ranking Republican on the committee , introduced 77 amendments .\nThe gay rights fight already is getting attention as a major sticking point because it will put majority Democrats on the spot .\nSen. Patrick J. Leahy , the committee chairman , introduced two different versions : One would apply to \u201c permanent partners , \u201d which critics said could invite widespread fraud . The other would only apply to same-sex couples who are legally married , which given the laws in various states would dramatically limit who could qualify .\nSEE ALSO : Report : Legalizing illegal immigrants to cost $ 6.3 trillion\n\u201c For immigration reform to be truly comprehensive , it must include protections for all families , \u201d the Vermont Democrat said . \u201c We must end the discrimination that gay and lesbian families face in our immigration law . \u201d\nHis amendment , though , will test Democrats who want to see a bill pass but also want to expand it .\nThe eight senators \u2014 four Democrats and four Republicans \u2014 who wrote the bill now must decide how they will approach the amendments .\nIn 2007 , the last time the Senate debated a bill , the sponsors had a deal to oppose all major amendments and to try to keep the basic agreement intact . But that tactic failed as Democrats attached an amendment limiting the size of a future guest-worker program . The bill collapsed under opposition from both ends of the political spectrum .\nAs of Tuesday evening , the Judiciary Committee had posted 130 amendments from six members of the committee \u2014 and that didn \u2019 t include Mr. Sessions \u2019 49 amendments , nor those of 11 other committee members .\nThe sheer weight of those amendments presages a long fight in committee before the bill even reaches the floor .\nRepublicans still felt the entire debate was rushed , given that the final version of the main 867-page bill was introduced just last week .\n\u201c Unfortunately , members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have had less time to review this nearly 1,000-page bill than the special interests who wrote it behind closed doors , \u201d Mr . Sessions said .\nHe said the bill falls short of the promises its sponsors made to build a border fence , to have illegal immigrants pay back taxes and to prevent them from gaining public benefits .\nThe crux of the Senate bill is a deal to offer illegal immigrants quick legal status , but to withhold a full pathway to citizenship until the Homeland Security Department makes strides on border security and interior enforcement .",

        "date": "2017-02-11",
        "content": "President Donald Trump \u2019 s deportation force promise may be coming true .\nOver the last five days , Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agents conducted what they call an \u201c enforcement surge \u201d in the Los Angeles area , arresting more than 160 undocumented immigrants . Immigrants \u2019 rights groups and lawyers told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that ICE also increased its enforcement activities\u2014including , in some cases , in apartment buildings\u2014in a number of cities around the country , including Atlanta , Phoenix , Charlotte , and Austin .\nICE officials and the White House say this is normal . Activists , lawyers , and members of Congress say it \u2019 s a major change\u2014and likely just the beginning .\n\u201c The muscle to do this kind of stuff is here\u2014it \u2019 s just that the leash has been taken off , \u201d said Sarah Owings , an immigration attorney in Atlanta . \u201c They \u2019 re out and they \u2019 re hunting . \u201d\nOwings said upward of 40 undocumented immigrants have been detained in the Savanna , Georgia , area over the last two days , according to the family of an undocumented immigrant currently detained there . And she said she knows of two apartment complexes with high concentrations of Latino residents where ICE officers went door-to-door looking for specific individuals . When people opened their doors , Owings said , the ICE officers would ask everyone present to show proof that they were in the United States legally .\n\u201c They \u2019 re picking up and rounding up anyone they can get , \u201d she said .\nIn a statement , an ICE spokesperson criticized recent media coverage of the Los Angeles apprehensions .\n\u201c The rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false , dangerous , and irresponsible , \u201d the spokesperson said . \u201c These reports create panic and put communities and law enforcement personnel in unnecessary danger . Individuals who falsely report such activities are doing a disservice to those they claim to support . \u201d\nOn Feb. 9 , an ICE official told reporters on background that reports the agency arrested 100 people in the Los Angeles area that day were \u201c grossly exaggerated. \u201d Virginia Kice , an ICE spokesperson , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 there were 38 arrests in the L.A. area that day .\nKice and Michael Short , a White House senior assistant press secretary , both told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the enforcement activities were routine .\nMany immigration activists and Capitol Hill Democrats say they doubt that . Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva , a Democrat from Arizona , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that among his conference , there \u2019 s \u201c not much \u201d confidence in the agency \u2019 s statements . And Bob Libal , the executive director of Grassroots Leadership\u2014a group based in Austin that opposes immigrant detention and deportation\u2014said he suspected the agency may have targeted Austin because of frustration over the county sheriff \u2019 s recently announced refusal to comply with ICE \u2019 s detainer requests .\nLibal said his group estimates that about two dozen undocumented immigrants have been arrested by ICE agents on Feb. 9 and 10 .\n\u201c We have a deportation defense hotline and it \u2019 s ringing off the hook , \u201d he said .\nHe added that he wasn \u2019 t aware of a time in recent memory when that many undocumented immigrants were arrested in Austin in such a short period of time .\n\u201c This is a level of intimidation that seems new , \u201d he said . \u201c And our community is not going to be intimidated .\n\u201c It very much feels retaliatory , \u201d he added . \u201c It feels like a vicious attack . \u201d\nGrijalva said he thought the enforcement surge may be a response to Trump \u2019 s recent defeat in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , where a three-judge panel moved unanimously to block enforcement of his travel ban .\n\u201c Every time he gets hit politically , like in the 9th Circuit , his reaction is to go back to that mantra and use it and use it , \u201d Grijalva said , of Trump \u2019 s anti-immigrant rhetoric during the campaign . \u201c Except now it \u2019 s not campaign rhetoric .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not a conspiracy-theory person , \u201d he added . \u201c But it walks like a duck . It \u2019 s got ta be a duck . \u201d\n\u201c They are routine , enforcement operations targeting criminals , \u201d Short said . \u201c Rep . Grijalva \u2019 s comments couldn \u2019 t be further from the truth . \u201d\nKice said ICE \u2019 s enforcement activities are motivated solely by public safety and law enforcement concerns .\n\u201c Our enforcement operations are lead-driven and they are targeted , \u201d she said .\nAnd David Marin , who helps head ICE \u2019 s Los Angeles field office , told reporters on a conference call on Friday evening that the L.A. enforcement activity was \u201c nothing out of the ordinary . \u201d\n\u201c These are targeted enforcement operations , nothing different than what we \u2019 ve been doing for the past five , six , seven years , \u201d he said .\nImmigration activists point to one of Trump \u2019 s first executive orders as the impetus behind the enforcement surge . In a blog post , Azadeh Erfani of the Capital Area Immigrants \u2019 Rights Coalition wrote that the president \u2019 s Jan. 25 executive order titled \u201c Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States \u201d made upward of 8 million undocumented immigrants top priorities for deportation .\n\u201c Our immigrant community likely will experience the paradox of being both at the margins of society and the target of law enforcement , \u201d Erfani wrote .\nTrump hasn \u2019 t kept all his immigration-crackdown campaign promises ; despite making it a key campaign issue , the president has yet to undo the temporary deportation protections that President Barack Obama made available to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children .\nA staffer for a Democratic congressional office that frequently criticized the Obama administration \u2019 s immigration enforcement practices said the week \u2019 s enforcement uptick was uniquely concerning . He said that though the ICE conducted raids that resulted in dozens of arrests during Obama \u2019 s presidency , this particular surge worries activists because it \u2019 s happening in so many cities around the country at the same time and in the wake of Trump \u2019 s executive order . Some Hill Democrats worry this could be the new normal , he added .\n\u201c It will happen until the beds are full , \u201d she said . \u201c They \u2019 ll have to stop at some point , right ? \u201d",

        "date": "2016-04-17",
        "content": "If this president is allowed to reinterpret the law , what about the next one ?\nSometimes it seems the Supreme Court \u2019 s main purpose these days is to resolve disputes between Republicans and President Obama .\nToward the end of Obama \u2019 s first term , the court ruled on a challenge to his signature health care law . On Monday , as Obama approaches the end of his second term , the justices are set to consider his executive order that would allow millions of undocumented workers to avoid deportation .\nObama won the first of these cases . The court ruled , correctly in our view , that Obamacare 's insurance mandate did not violate the Constitution . The president 's backers hope and believe that the court will take a similar tack in U.S. v. Texas , finding that the case is a political squabble dressed up as a legal dispute .\nTo be sure , Obama \u2019 s quest to reform the immigration system is a worthy cause . Keeping millions of undocumented immigrants in a state of legal limbo makes little sense .\nLike his predecessor , George W. Bush , Obama backed legislation to grant these immigrants a path to legal status while beefing up border enforcement and making needed changes to the legal immigration system . That legislation passed with bipartisan support in the Senate but ran into a buzz saw of opposition from conservatives in the House .\nFaced with legislative gridlock , the president acted unilaterally . Obama \u2019 s 2014 order , known as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans , combined with a predecessor order he issued two years earlier , would allow as many as 5 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented people to remain in the United States without fear of deportation .\nWhile courts have typically given great deference to presidents in matters of immigration , this is simply too sweeping a policy change to exclude the legislative branch . It does the right thing in the wrong way .\nThe order has many flaws . Because it could be rescinded by a future president , it would not give immigrants the certainty they 'd need to come out from the shadows and fully participate in their communities . Because it addresses only undocumented workers , it would do nothing for backlogs in legal immigration and a shortage of skilled workers .\nThe order 's biggest flaw , however , is the precedent it would set by giving the president sweeping authority to interpret immigration laws virtually any way he or she sees fit . The same people who think Obama should have broad powers over immigration enforcement will feel a lot differently if a Republican wins the White House in November .\nImagine what orders Ted Cruz or Donald Trump would issue if elected president . Trump has advocated mass deportations , temporarily banning entry of foreign Muslims , and building a border wall financed by confiscating the remittances that undocumented workers attempt to send to their families back home .\nIn an interview with NBC News this year , Trump said he would n't hesitate to issue executive orders , noting that Obama had \u201c led the way \u201d with his actions .\nThe court would be wise to limit the president 's authority in this area , and leave Congress and the White House to work out through the legislative process how to handle undocumented immigrants , as maddening as that might be .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board , separate from the news staff . Most editorials are coupled with an opposing view \u2014 a unique \u2588\u2588\u2588 feature .\nTo read more editorials , go to the Opinion front page or sign up for the daily Opinion e-mail newsletter .",

        "content": "Democrats dug in their heels Sunday on President Trump \u2019 s threat to shut down the government unless he gets money for his border wall , saying if the president makes good on his demand , the American people will suffer .\nBut the White House contends American citizens are already suffering \u2014 with or without a shutdown \u2014 because of the rise in illegal immigration .\nThe two sides showed no sign of willingness to compromise Sunday , with just four days left to broker an agreement before the federal government partially shuts down .\n\u201c We should not let a temper tantrum \u2014 threats \u2014 push us in the direction of doing something even our Republican colleagues know is wrong , \u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer told NBC .\nThe New York Democrat said Republicans in Congress \u201c have to have the guts \u201d to tell the president he \u2019 s wrong for refusing to fund the government unless he gets $ 5 billion for his border wall .\n\u201c President Trump should understand there are not the votes for the wall in the House or the Senate . He is not going to get the wall in any form , \u201d he said .\nAnd the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Rep. Elijah Cummings , Maryland Democrat , said voters want the government to help them , not hurt them , suggesting a shutdown will politically damage Republicans .\n\u201c Whenever I hear a president say to the American people at Christmastime , \u2018 I am going to shut down your government , \u2019 it pains me because I know it \u2019 s going to make a bad Christmas for a lot of people , \u201d he told CNN .\nBut White House adviser Stephen Miller said Mr. Trump will do \u201c whatever is necessary \u201d to get the money to build the border wall .\n\u201c They can either choose to fight for Americans \u2014 working class \u2014 or to promote illegal immigration . You can \u2019 t do both , \u201d Mr. Miller said of Democrats in an interview Sunday with CBS .\nCongress is running up against a Friday deadline to finish funding the government , with several news reports suggesting they may look to a short-term \u201c continuing resolution \u201d that funds the government at current levels to get them past the holidays and into the new year .\nSen. Susan Collins , Maine Republican , told ABC she wants to see lawmakers take up a proposal that provided $ 2.5 billion this year and over the next 10 years for border security , which would fund a border fence , increase technology and patrol agents along the southern border .\n\u201c There is absolutely no excuse to shut down government on this issue or any issue . I have suggested we revisit a compromise proposal we brought forward earlier this year , \u201d she said on Sunday , breaking with her party \u2019 s leader .\nHouse Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Mr. Schumer have offered Mr. Trump two other options , and they both include some money \u2014 roughly $ 1.3 billion \u2014 for the wall .\nBut it remains unclear whether the president will accept any compromise after his televised stand off with the two Democratic leaders in the Oval Office last week , where he demanded the $ 5 billion and claimed he isn \u2019 t afraid to shut down the government .\n\u201c I am proud to shut down the government for border security , \u201d Mr. Trump said .",

        "topic": "Saving DREAMers is only this hard because Donald Trump has made it this hard",
        "date": "2018-02-14",
        "content": "This week , the Senate is debating a solution for DREAMers . Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , making good on his word , brought an empty bill to the floor , permitting both sides to try to round up 60 votes to fill in the text . Inauspiciously , the first day was consumed by a disagreement on where to start . McConnell wanted to begin with a vote on banning sanctuary cities . Chuck Schumer , speaking for the Democrats , demanded the Senate start with President Trump \u2019 s proposal . The dispute was particularly confusing because neither starting point has a remote hope of passage . An argument over which idea to reject first is very Senate 2018 .\nBut it \u2019 s worth zooming out . The public conversation around the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program has gotten confused , with everyone agreeing to pretend , for various self-interested reasons , that President Trump actually wants a DACA solution , and fast . Trump and the Republicans have adopted this posture because DREAMers are wildly popular \u2014 giving DREAMers legal status is about twice as popular as Trump himself . Meanwhile , Democrats have agreed to Trump \u2019 s framing of his position because they think it helps pressure Trump into a deal .\nNegotiations on DACA have begun . Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal . Wouldn \u2019 t it be great if we could finally , after so many years , solve the DACA puzzle . This will be our last chance , there will never be another opportunity ! March 5th . \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 13 , 2018\nThere is a deep strangeness to this rhetoric . Trump created a crisis for DREAMers \u2014 all this began when he unilaterally decided to end the DACA program \u2014 and then refused the obvious compromises that could have fixed it . Now he is threatening a veto of the likeliest bipartisan compromises in the Senate . He has taken 690,000 hostages and is now trumpeting the wonderful opportunity everyone has to pay his policy ransom in order to free them , and he is doing all of it while insisting he desperately wants to free them too .\nThe truth is , Trump doesn \u2019 t want a DACA solution . He is willing to accept a DACA solution in return for other things he wants \u2014 notably , heavy investments in border security and a large cut in legal immigration \u2014 but within the negotiations , a DACA fix is the thing Trump is treating as a concession on his part , not the thing he is trying to make happen . If it were the thing he was trying to make happen , it would have happened already .\nRight now , the fate of the DREAMers doesn \u2019 t depend mainly on Democrats . It depends on Republicans . If McConnell and Paul Ryan want a deal , they could have one in moments . If Trump wants to save DREAMers , he could do so , and get money for his wall and other border enforcement and immigration changes , tomorrow . But what he actually wants is a suite of restrictionist changes to immigration that are noxious not just to Democrats , but to DREAMers themselves , and he is trying to hide that unpopular agenda behind pro-DREAMer rhetoric , even as he \u2019 s holding DREAMers hostage to pass it .\nThis shell game works until it doesn \u2019 t . If there \u2019 s no deal , and the Trump administration begins deporting DREAMers over Democratic objections , his real position will become very clear , very quickly .\nIf the Senate passes a DREAMer deal , will the House vote on it ?\nWhich bring us back to Congress . My conversations with both Democratic and Republican staffers , both inside and outside of leadership , have ended in unanimous shrugs . No one knows what , if anything , can actually pass the Senate . And the difficulty of that question pales in comparison to the difficulty of what , if anything , can pass the House . Ryan has said he will not bring a bill to the floor that doesn \u2019 t have Trump \u2019 s blessing , and so it is entirely possible that the Senate will pass a deal that never sees a House vote .\nIf that happens , Democrats have little recourse . They \u2019 re in the minority in both the House and the Senate , and after passing last week \u2019 s spending deal , they no longer have the threat of shutting down the government .\nThis is something I got wrong in my initial reaction to the shutdown deal . In preserving the option to shut the government down in the future , I argued , there was no real loss for Democrats , as they hadn \u2019 t abandoned any of their leverage . What I didn \u2019 t appreciate immediately was how much the shutdown had spooked Senate Democrats \u2014 after shutting down the government , they realized they had no strategy for winning the shutdown , and they certainly had no strategy for forcing Trump to fold amid the kind of high-stakes cable news showdown he lives for . So while the shutdown deal held open the option of a future shutdown , in fact , that option had closed , because Senate Democrats had lost faith in it . Now it \u2019 s gone entirely .\nOver the past week , I \u2019 ve been asking Senate Democrats what leverage they have on immigration given that they can no longer shut down the government . The answer , universally , is what leverage exists comes from the issue itself . DREAMers are popular , and deporting them is unpopular . But Donald Trump is the president of the United States , Mitch McConnell is the majority leader of the US Senate , and Paul Ryan is the speaker of the House . They control the process , and they control the outcome .",

        "content": "An eight-year-old boy from Guatemala has died in US government custody , officials say , the second migrant child to die in US detention this month .\nThe border agency says the boy died on Monday night hours after showing signs of illness . A Texas congressman named him as Felipe Al\u00f3nzo-Gomez .\nThe child was detained with his father on 18 December after illegally crossing the US-Mexico border .\nA seven-year-old girl died earlier this month just hours after being detained .\nJakelin Caal , also from Guatemala , developed a high fever and died of liver failure . Her funeral was held in her village on Tuesday .\nThousands of migrants have travelled from Central America - mainly from Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador - to the US border .\nMany say they are fleeing persecution , poverty and violence in their home countries and plan to seek asylum in the US .\nIn a new , lengthy statement , the US Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) said the boy , whose identity has not been officially confirmed , died at 23:48 local time ( 06:48 GMT ) on 24 December . The cause of death is still unknown .\nAfter being detained in El Paso , Texas , he and his father were taken to a local processing centre , where they spent two days . They were then sent to El Paso Border Patrol Station , where they were held for another two days .\nOn 22 December , they were transferred to Alamogordo Border Patrol Station , in neighbouring New Mexico .\nOn Monday morning , an agent noticed that the boy `` was coughing and appeared to have glossy eyes '' . He was taken with his father to a hospital where he was diagnosed with a common cold and given Tylenol ( paracetamol ) .\nWhile being evaluated for release , he was found to have a fever of 103F ( 39.4C ) and held for more observation . He was released shortly afterwards with a prescription for an antibiotic and ibuprofen .\nThe boy and his father were taken to a temporary site at the Highway 70 checkpoint , where the child received the medication . Two hours later , he vomited .\nHis father declined further medical assistance , the CBP said , as the child had been feeling better .\nThe child appeared lethargic at around 22:00 , when he was sent back to the hospital . While being transported , the boy vomited and lost consciousness , and doctors at the hospital were unable to revive him .\nThe CBP earlier said the boy died just after midnight . It did not explain why they were held for so long .\nHis father remains in custody . The Associated Press news agency reported they had plans to go to Johnson City , Tennessee .\nCBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said the death was `` tragic '' and announced that the agency would conduct further medical checks on all children in custody , with a focus on those under the age of 10 .\nHe also said the CBP would review its policies and work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) to improve custody conditions .\nHuman rights groups criticised the CBP and Guatemala 's foreign ministry called for an investigation .\nTexas Congressman Joaquin Castro called for a congressional investigation , saying the administration 's policy of turning people away at the border `` is putting families and children in great danger '' .\nThe Trump administration has tried to deter asylum seekers from crossing the border irregularly between ports of entry , warning that they could face arrest , prosecution and deportation .\nBut , at the same time , it is restricting access to those trying to cross through official ports of entry , creating a long wait for applicants .\nAmong them are thousands of Central American migrants who travelled together in so-called `` caravans '' , and arrived at the border with California in recent weeks .\nPresident Trump has vowed to keep each migrant on the Mexican side of the border until courts have decided their cases .",

        "content": "President Trump is suddenly on a surprising winning streak when it comes to immigration .\nWith his border wall , where the Supreme Court has cleared the way to begin construction under his emergency declaration , and negotiations with Latin American neighbors , Mr. Trump in the past weeks has finally begun to make headway on a number of major items on his immigration checklist .\nThe court and foreign policy victories were coupled with some policy moves within the administration that could further constrain the surge of migrants , including guidance issued Friday telling asylum officers to make sure migrants are fleeing state-sanctioned violence before they are granted asylum .\n\u201c The Trump administration is trying to throw everything it can at this problem , \u201d said Jessica Vaughan , policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies .\nThe big moves last week included an agreement signed with Guatemala that will allow the U.S. to send any asylum-seekers who cross that country \u2019 s territory en route to the U.S. back to Guatemala to ask for asylum there instead .\nGiven Guatemala \u2019 s strategic geographic location \u2014 it lies on Mexico \u2019 s southern border , and land travelers must cross it during their journey north \u2014 the agreement could allow the U.S. to deny tens of thousands of asylum-seekers the chance to ask for status before they reach the border .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve long been working with Guatemala , and now we can do it the right way , \u201d Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office after signing the deal with Guatemalan Interior Minister Enrique Degenhart .\nHours later , the president received news of another win : The Supreme Court , in a 5-4 ruling , had cleared the way for him to use his emergency border declaration to use Pentagon money to build more of his wall .\nThe Republican-appointed justices ended a lower-court blockade of his budgeting moves , limits that a federal district judge in California and later an appeals court had imposed while the case was being argued on the merits .\nThe high court didn \u2019 t reveal its reasoning , but the ruling is a major victory at a crucial time .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s attorneys told the justices they were racing a Sept. 30 deadline . If they didn \u2019 t obligate the money by then , they would lose the chance to spend it on the wall .\nThe immediate effect of the ruling is to let the administration tap several billion dollars within the Pentagon \u2019 s budget and direct it toward building the wall , which was Mr. Trump \u2019 s most visible 2016 campaign promise .\nOpponents said they will continue to fight , including pressing lower courts to speed up the arguments on their broader challenge to the emergency declaration \u2019 s constitutionality .\n\u201c This is not over , \u201d said Dror Ladin , an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , said the Supreme Court ruling \u201c undermines the Constitution . \u201d\nMr. Trump expressed his enthusiasm in his unique system of uppercase letters on Twitter : \u201c Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law ! \u201d\nThe two victories for Mr. Trump last week follow on his success in June , when he used the threat of tariffs to force Mexico to the bargaining table . Mexico agreed to do more to head off migrants crossing its territory and to take back more Central American asylum-seekers , making them wait in Mexico while their cases proceed through the U.S. immigration courts .\nThe effects of the Mexico deal were already having some effect .\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan told \u201c Fox Business Sunday \u201d that the number of illegal immigrants nabbed at the U.S.-Mexico border fell 28 % in June and is down another 20 % in July .\nIn May , Customs and Border Protection encountered 4,650 unauthorized migrants a day . The number now is 2,600 , he said .\nThe emergency border spending bill that Mr. Trump won from Congress a month ago has also helped ease overcrowding at border facilities .\nAt its peak in early June , CBP had 19,000 people in custody . That number is now 7,200 , Mr. McAleenan said .\nOne of Mr. McAleenan \u2019 s top lieutenants took yet another step Friday to try to reduce the flow of migrants by ordering asylum officers to cast a dim eye on some asylum claims .\n\u201c Private violence \u201d doesn \u2019 t cut it , said Ken Cuccinelli , acting director of U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services . While conditions may be rough , he said , there just isn \u2019 t enough \u201c pervasive \u201d violence in El Salvador , Honduras and Guatemala to automatically grant asylum to people fleeing those countries .\nMr. Trump started winning immigration fights after he revamped his team , shuffling the leaders of the Homeland Security Department and each of the three agencies that handles immigration . The department and all three agencies are now headed by temporary officers .\nThe administration \u2019 s moves will continue to face scrutiny in the courts .\nSeveral activist groups have vowed to challenge the Guatemala asylum agreement . Critics said that country isn \u2019 t safe enough nor capable enough to provide asylum to others crossing its territory .\n\u201c Such an arrangement would make a mockery of the notion that those fleeing persecution in Central America have any recourse , \u201d said Eric Schwartz , president of Refugees International .\nMs. Vaughan , though , said the Guatemala agreement was proof that the U.S. does have leverage with foreign countries that previous administrations hadn \u2019 t used .\n\u201c What remains to be seen is which message comes through stronger in Central America ( and around the world now ) \u2014 do they hear that the risk of failure is much higher now because Trump and the other governments are cracking down , or do they hear that American judges are blocking his efforts ? \u201d she said .\nShe said the Trump administration must be prepared to fend off those legal challenges .\n\u201c Now that Trump has come to realize that Congress isn \u2019 t going to be much help , and that he needs to go at this problem from all angles , with every immigration agency involved , it looks like we are finally starting to see results , \u201d she said .",

        "date": "2013-05-31",
        "content": "Fazliddin Kurbanov is from Uzbekistan , a Central Asian country that borders Afghanistan . This month , Mr. Kurbanov was arrested in Boise , Idaho , charged with teaching people how to build bombs that could be used to target public transportation . He is accused of conspiring with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , which the United States recognizes as a terrorist organization . Mr. Kurbanov was here legally , admitted as a refugee in 2009 .\nLast year , in Aurora , Colo. , Jamshid Muhtorov was arrested and charged with providing material support to the Islamic Jihad Union , which the United States recognizes as a terrorist organization . Like Mr. Kurbanov , Mr. Muhtorov is from Uzbekistan and was also here legally as a refugee .\nIn 2011 , in my hometown of Bowling Green , Ky. , Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi were arrested and accused of supporting efforts to kill American troops in Iraq . Both men are from Iraq . Both were also here legally as refugees .\nThe Bowling Green Daily News reported that these Iraqi refugees \u201c slipped through the vetting process that allowed both of them political asylum in the United States. \u201d Apparently , Mr. Kurbanov and Mr. Muhtorov \u201c slipped through \u201d as well .\nSo did Ulugbek Kodirov , who was arrested in Birmingham , Ala. , last year and sentenced to 15 years in prison for plotting to kill President Obama . Kodirov was from Uzbekistan and was in the country illegally on a student-visa overstay .\nLast month , two pressure-cooker bombs were exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon , killing three and injuring 264 people . The Washington Post noted of the suspects , brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev : \u201c With their baseball hats and sauntering gaits , they appeared to friends and neighbors like ordinary American boys . But the Boston bombing suspects were refugees from another world \u2014 the blood , rubble and dirty wars of the Russian Caucasus . \u201d\nI condemn government inefficiency and incompetence often . The targets for criticism are endless . In the repeating patterns from these refugee and visa cases , however , we see potentially dangerous scenarios in which we can not afford any excuses .\nIn the case of Sept. 11 , 2001 , if the State Department had more adequately monitored visa overstays and application screening , most of hijackers would have been detected and caught beforehand . After the Boston bombing , I asked what faults we might have in our current intelligence that allowed the Russian government to identify the suspects as potential terrorists before the US government did .\nThese questions are crucial as Congress continues to debate immigration reform , in which vital national security concerns must be addressed . Our visa and refugee programs deserve far more monitoring and scrutiny , and there is something desperately wrong with a \u201c vetting process \u201d that makes so many repeated mistakes .\nNot all countries are the same , and neither are refugees . The National Security Registration System created by Congress in 2002 was intended to give extra screening to those coming from countries with higher populations of extremists . Suspended in 2011 , to my knowledge , there has been no effort to replace it with similar screening . There \u2019 s really no excuse for this . We send men and women all over the world to fight terrorism and often seem unwilling to take the most common-sense precautions at home with our immigration policies . We know that the old system had its problems , but we also know that what we \u2019 re doing now isn \u2019 t working .\nIt is ironic that some of the things we call \u201c national security \u201d in our foreign policy actually have little to do with protecting the nation , while some of the simple things we don \u2019 t do in our immigration policy could better protect us . It \u2019 s time we did them .\nAfter the tragic attack in Boston , I sent the following in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid :\n\u201c I respectfully request that the Senate consider the following two conditions as part of the comprehensive immigration-reform debate : One , the Senate needs a thorough examination of the facts in Massachusetts to see if legislation is necessary to prevent a similar situation in the future . Two , national security protections must be rolled into comprehensive immigration reform to make sure the federal government does everything it can to prevent immigrants with malicious intent from using our immigration system to gain entry into the United States in order to commit future acts of terror . \u201d\nMy proposed amendments to immigration-reform legislation seek to correct flaws in our current system , and these weaknesses must be addressed before any genuine reform can happen .\nThey must also be addressed before another attack or tragedy happens \u2014 and it is our job in Congress to address them .\nSen. Rand Paul , Kentucky Republican , is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security committees .",

        "content": "Assaults on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents reached a decade high in 2017 , and assaults on Border Patrol agents also have surged in recent years , according to government numbers that seem to support agents \u2019 claims that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally increasingly are looking to fight rather than flee .\nThe new numbers , reported by Homeland Security \u2019 s inspector general , could even be underselling the problem , investigators said , because the government doesn \u2019 t do a good job of tracking incidents , and agents and officers don \u2019 t always report them properly .\nBut the report does signal renewed danger particularly on the southwest border , where agents say a surge in illegal immigration in recent years generally correlates with growing violence .\nProsecutors , meanwhile , often refuse to bring charges or win cases against the perpetrators , the audit found .\nAt the border , the most frequent method of attack was projectiles \u2014 usually large rocks \u2014 which accounted for half of assaults . But bombs , clubs , knives , guns and even laser pointers to blind agents have all been used .\nMost of the injuries were minor and didn \u2019 t require treatment , the audit found .\nCustoms and Border Protection recorded 1,089 assaults in 2010 , which steadily dropped through 2014 , when there were just 381 assaults . But things turned violent once again , steadily rising to 856 assaults in 2017 .\nLast year was the most violent this decade at the border , with 28 assaults per every 10,000 apprehensions .\nIn the interior , meanwhile , ICE agents and officers saw 48 assaults in 2017 , tying 2010 as the highest in records going back to the beginning of the decade .\nICE officers , who handle deportations , and Border Patrol agents , who patrol the line between the U.S. and Mexico , say they \u2019 ve seen an increasing willingness on the part of migrants to resort to violence in recent years .\nOne of those assaults recorded in 2017 came when ICE officers tried to apprehend Lester Sadict Cruz-Garcia , an immigrant from Honduras who was arrested by police in New York on a domestic assault charge . Police released him into the community , ignoring a request by ICE that he be held .\nDeportation officers then had to go out into the community to track him down at his home . When they approached him , he struggled and kicked , attempting the get away , the officers said .\nThey eventually got him in handcuffs and tried to get him into the back of an ICE vehicle when he bit one of the officers on the arm . The officer was taken to a hospital , where he was prescribed antibiotics .\nCruz-Garcia was sentenced in June to 364 days in jail .\nIn another incident last year , ICE officers in Massachusetts were trying to deport Mohammed Kenneh to Liberia . They drove him to Logan International Airport in Boston , but he knocked one officer to the ground and then used the handcuffs around his wrists to ensnare the officer \u2019 s hand , refusing to let go .\nThe officer had to be taken to the emergency room .",

        "topic": "New Research Finds that Immigrant Crime Is Still Low",
        "date": "2016-10-12",
        "content": "Last year we published a blog summarizing the research on how immigrants affect the crime rate in the United States . There are two major types of studies that examine this question .\nThe first uses Census data of the institutionalized population to investigate immigrant versus native incarceration rates . Although the Census evidence isn \u2019 t perfect because of potential issues with reporting immigration status and different types of incarceration , these studies show that immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than similarly-aged natives . The second type is a macro-level or area study that looks at the crime rates in places that have experienced large waves of immigration . These generally find that immigration either lowers or has little effect on crime rates . The research on unauthorized immigrant crime rates is poor .\nA few recent papers recently extended these findings . The first by David Green seeks to determine whether immigrants affect violent and drug-related crime in the United States on the state-level . It looks at state-level rates of violent crime and drug arrests pooled for the 2012-2014 years against pooled statistics on foreign-born and Mexican nationals by immigration status , specifically legal versus unauthorized immigrants . Green finds no association between immigrant population size and increased violent crime . However , he does find a small but statistically significant association between unauthorized immigrant population size and arrests for drug offenses .\nThe second by criminologists Biana Bersani and Alex Piquero investigated whether immigrants are less crime-prone than natives because immigrants are less likely to report crimes . If it was true that immigrants were less likely to report crimes and most of the victims of immigrant-crime were other immigrants , then the real immigrant crime rate could be much higher than the data is revealing due to a lack of reporting . This would also increase their relative crime rates compared to second-generation and other U.S.-born Americans who are more likely to report crimes .\nOn its surface , this theory has some appeal because immigrants are generally weary of dealing with government authorities that subjected them to this bureaucratic monstrosity \u2013 especially if they are unauthorized . Bersani and Piquero analyzed data from a 7-year longitudinal study called Pathways to Desistance that logged the respondents \u2019 immigration status , age , self-reported criminal and arrest records , and official criminal and arrest histories . They found no systematic difference between the self-reported and official criminal and arrest histories of the respondents by immigrant generation . Although not conclusive , this should strongly bias us against the notion that the low-levels of reported immigrant criminality are not based on reporting differences . The evidence of low immigrant criminality continues to grow .",

        "content": "Story highlights President Obama says `` we just need Congress to finish the job ''\nThe 68-32 Senate vote sends the measure to the House for consideration\nSpeaker Boehner says the House will stick to its own version of immigration reform\nThe Senate bill offers a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants\nThe U.S. Senate gave final approval Thursday to a roughly 1,200-page bill that promises to overhaul immigration laws for the first time since 1986 , creating a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents while ratcheting up security along the Mexican border .\nSenators passed the sweeping legislation -- initially drafted by the four Democrats and four Republicans in the chamber 's so-called `` Gang of Eight '' -- by a 68-32 vote .\nFourteen Republicans joined a united Democratic caucus in supporting the bill , which is backed by the White House and has the potential to become the crowning legislative achievement of President Barack Obama 's second term .\nIn a White House statement , Obama hailed the Senate vote as `` a critical step '' toward fixing what he called a broken immigration system . He labeled the measure that now goes to the Republican-controlled House a compromise , adding that `` we just need Congress to finish the job . ''\nThe Senate vote included a rare adherence to old-fashioned protocol . Vice President Joe Biden presided in his constitutional capacity as head of the Senate , and senators voted one-by-one from their desks , calling out `` aye '' or `` no . ''\nRepublican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas broke the drama of the moment when he mistakenly voted `` aye , '' then quickly asked the clerk to make it `` no '' as the chamber erupted in laughter . Biden tapped his gavel and called for order .\nJUST WATCHED Next step for immigration overhaul ? Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH McCain : Immigration bill is strong 01:47\nJUST WATCHED Immigration overhaul passes Senate test Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Immigration overhaul passes Senate test 01:40\nBefore announcing the result , Biden warned against outbursts from the public gallery , but chants of `` Yes we can '' and `` Si se puede '' broke out after he read the tally . Biden called for the sergeant at arms to restore order .\n`` Today is another historic day in the Senate , '' said Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont . `` This legislation will reunite families . It will bring millions of people out of the shadows and into our legal system . It will spur job growth and reduce our deficit . And it will make us safer . ''\n`` The time has come to act in the interest of all Americans , '' declared Sen. Bob Menendez , D-New Jersey , a member of the Gang of Eight . `` I hope that message will be heard loud and clear in the House ( of Representatives ) . ''\nMost congressional conservatives , however , remain staunchly opposed to the measure , and have declared it dead on arrival in the House .\nObama warned in his statement that opponents of immigration reform will try even harder to derail it . Noting the broad support for the Senate bill from the business community , organized labor and others , he urged people to contact their House representatives and `` tell them to do the right thing . ''\nRepublicans are sharply divided over the politically sensitive issue . In the wake of the GOP 's crushing loss among Hispanics in the 2012 election , many top voices in the party have pushed for an endorsement of some form of a path to citizenship for the country 's roughly 11 million undocumented residents .\n`` No one should dispute ( that ) like every sovereign nation on this planet , we have a right to control who comes in . But unlike other countries , we are not afraid of people coming in here from other places , '' said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , the most prominent Republican in the Gang of Eight and a potential 2016 presidential candidate . `` I support this reform . Not just because I believe in immigrants , but because I believe in America even more . ''\nFor many of the GOP 's strongest supporters , any path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally is a form of unforgivable amnesty . They also do n't trust the Obama administration to fully enact the bill 's new border security measures , which are generally opposed by progressives .\n`` There 's just no way I can look my constituents in the eye and tell them that today 's assurances wo n't become tomorrow 's disappointments , '' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky . `` We 'll never resolve the immigration problem on a bipartisan basis either now or in the future until we can prove that the border is secure as a condition of legalization . ''\nSen. Mike Lee , R-Utah , called the vote on the measure `` largely symbolic '' and predicted the bill would ultimately be relegated to the `` ash heap of history . ''\nIf enacted , the measure would create a 13-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants , while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on America 's farms .\nA recently added border security amendment -- introduced by GOP Sens . John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee -- would require 20,000 more border agents , complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico , and deploy $ 3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .\nThe amendment also strengthens eligibility verification and border entry-exit controls .\nMost undocumented immigrants would be eligible for permanent residency only after the five conditions have been met and verified by the Department of Homeland Security .\nWhile Corker 's and Hoeven 's change appeared to sway some reticent Republicans in the Senate , top House Republicans remained opposed the overall blueprint .\n`` Apparently some have n't gotten the message : the House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes , '' said Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio . `` We 're going to do our own bill ... and move the legislation that reflects the will of our majority and the will of the American people . ''\nHouse Republicans have indicated their intention to tackle the issue with several smaller proposals instead of one larger bill .\nBoehner repeated his pledge to block a vote on any immigration measure that does n't have the support of a majority of House Republicans . Democrats contend the Senate version would pass the House if brought to a vote , with a united Democratic caucus joined by some Republicans .\nThe speaker also refused to take a position on whether or not there should be some kind of path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally .\nDemocrats have repeatedly warned they will not agree to a plan that lacks such a path .\nRegardless , Boehner said he hopes the House will deal with immigration reform this year .\n`` I have made it clear since the day after the election that this political football should stop , and that the Congress should deal with this issue , '' he said .",

''\n`` We are not sending children to jail with their parents , '' Sessions said . `` Noncitizens who cross our borders unlawfully , between our ports of entry , with children are not an exception . They are the ones who broke the law . They are the ones who endangered their own children on their trek . The United States , on the other hand , goes to extraordinary lengths to protect them while the parents go through a short detention period . ''\nPresident Trump weighed in on the issue , reminding that current policies regarding the separation of children of illegal immigrants from their parents who crossed the U.S. border existed under former President Barack Obama . He also called on Democrats to work with Republicans in Congress for changes to immigration law .\n`` Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation , for a change ! This is why we need more Republicans elected in November . Democrats are good at only three things , High Taxes , High Crime and Obstruction . Sad !

        "content": "Experts warn Republican nominee \u2019 s plan to restrict immigration on the basis of ideology is impractical and could be unconstitutional\nA quarter century after the end of the cold war , Donald Trump has proposed restoring ideological tests for immigrants , a move that legal experts say raises a tangle of practical and even constitutional concerns .\nIn a speech on Monday devoid of policy details or specifics , the Republican nominee called for the \u201c extreme vetting \u201d of immigrants , including a screening process to root out applicants who do not uphold \u201c American values \u201d .\nLaurence Tribe , a liberal constitutional law professor at Harvard University , said Trump \u2019 s proposal was \u201c a nonstarter \u201d .\n\u201c The proposal ... is very deeply un-American , is probably unconstitutional , would almost certainly fail in Congress and is another example of Trump having no idea what he \u2019 s talking about , \u201d he said .\nRestricting immigrants on the basis of ideology is anathema to American values , Tribe argues . Freedom of speech and religion are enshrined under the first amendment of the constitution and the enduring symbol of freedom is the Statue of Liberty welcoming weary immigrants to its shores .\nMcCarthyism redux : the long view of Trump 's immigration plan | James Nevius Read more\nThough immigrants outside the US would not receive the constitutional right to due process , Tribe said family members could bring challenges on their relatives \u2019 behalves .\nTrump has long called for tightening immigration controls as part of his plan to defeat Islamic State . In 2015 , Trump vowed to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US . In his speech on Monday , Trump appeared to revise that policy , calling for a temporary ban on immigrants from countries subject to terrorist attacks , though the original blanket ban on Muslims is still featured on his website .\nTrump \u2019 s proposal is not unprecedented . America has a long history of extreme vetting \u2013 which includes ideological tests \u2013 dating back to its foundation , when the leaders of the young nation worried anarchists would arrive and undermine the fledgling democracy .\nOne of the earliest and most flagrant immigration laws was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 , which barred Chinese workers from entering the US . The ban , which was passed amid anxiety over job scarcity and a depressed economy , was later extended at the turn of the 20th century to in effect deny entry to all Asian immigrants .\nBut Trump \u2019 s proposal draws from more recent history \u2013 the anti-communism measures employed during the cold war .\n\u201c In the cold war , we had an ideological screening test . The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today , \u201d he said during a speech at Youngstown State University in Ohio . \u201c I call it extreme vetting . \u201d\nIn 1952 , Congress passed the McCarran\u2013Walter Act , authorizing the federal government to refuse admission to classes of immigrants based on their political beliefs in an effort to keep members , former members and sympathizers of the communist party from entering the US . As the cold war came to a close , Congress revisited the law and in 1990 voted to greatly narrow the president \u2019 s ability to deny immigrant visas based on ideological grounds .\nTrump has claimed , citing the act , that he would have the authority as president to suspend entry to any class of person who would be \u201c detrimental to the interests of the United States \u201d . While the law grants the executive branch broad discretion over matters of immigration , the president would not have \u201c absolute \u201d authority \u2013 Congress could act to limit the president \u2019 s power .\nAnd yet if Trump managed to clear the initial hurdles and his proposal either passed Congress or survived the legal challenges experts say would surely arise , he would then have to contend with the operational difficulties of implementing such a sweeping proposal .\n\u201c If he does try to implement an ideological test , that leads to a question which came up early in the cold war : how do you administer that ? Is that a questionnaire ? Do you investigate the answers ? And if you do , how do you do that ? Who does that ? \u201d said Carl Bon Tempo , author of Americans at the Gate : The United States and Refugees during the Cold War .\n\u201c Enforcing an ideological litmus test takes an incredible amount of manpower and historically the result has been that it greatly slows the process . \u201d\nStephen Yale-Loehr , an immigration law professor at Cornell University , is skeptical of Trump \u2019 s promise to enhance a process that is already extensive and lengthy . Immigrants applying to come to the US are already asked to respond to a questionnaire and are subject to a background check that vets for , among other things , links to terrorist or extremist groups .\nHow is a border inspector supposed to determine whether an applicant is sufficiently \u2018 American \u2019 in his or her thinking ?\n\u201c Immigration to the United States would grind to a near halt if millions of people are subject to background checks based on subjective criteria , \u201d he said . \u201c How is a consular officer or a border inspector supposed to determine whether an applicant is sufficiently \u2018 American \u2019 in his or her thinking ? \u201d\nBased on Trump \u2019 s speech on Monday , Yale-Loehr speculated that the Republican might propose screening applicants \u2019 social media pages as part of the routine background check . Currently , officials only run social media checks in certain cases . He could also add requirements that family members be brought in for interviews as part of the application process . But he said it would be impossible to implement these changes , since they would require a vast mobilization of resources and manpower .\nTrump \u2019 s campaign has said it would expand on his immigration proposals in the coming weeks , and did not respond to multiple requests for comment .\nStill , experts say that on its surface , the proposal poses major logistical and practical problems that agencies grappled with during the cold war in the 1950s and , more recently , in the post-9/11 years .\nIn vilifying the immigrant , Trump is using a familiar playbook from American history , said Erika Lee , a professor of immigration history at the University of Minnesota . Throughout history , politicians exploited public anxiety over a scarcity of jobs and threats to national security to push through exclusionary laws .\n\u201c For many Americans , when they think back to America \u2019 s history , it \u2019 s the Ellis Island story . This is the way our mythology works , \u201d Lee said . \u201c But that has created some rose-colored glasses and helped to obscure the other side of the story , the one where we exclude whole groups of people based on race , ethnicity or ideological belief . \u201d",

        "topic": "ACLU in El Paso Helping \"International Commuters\" Know Their Rights",
        "date": "2015-05-21",
        "content": "On May 13 , dozens of members of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) on the U.S. side of the Santa Fe Street border bridge in El Paso , Texas were handing out pamphlets to people they refer to as \u201c international commuters \u201d from Mexico , listing their rights under American law . The group is part of the ACLU \u2019 s \u201c Know Your Rights \u201d campaign , which encourages immigrants \u2013 both legal and illegal \u2013 to report abuse when their rights are violated while crossing the border .\n\u201c We are working towards policies that will change that , and will address that type of treatment to innocent people. \u201d said Cynthia Pompa , representing an ACLU office New Mexico , as reported by local El Paso news station KTSM . \u201c Everyone should feel like they can be respected , that they \u2019 re not criminals . They are just here to go to school , to contribute to the economy . \u201d\nBut even Pompa acknowledged that the vast majority of border crossers who come into contact with Border Patrol agents or CBP inspectors at the ports of entry are not subjected to any abuse at all . She gave KTSM an example of a 54 year-old woman who underwent a fruitless cavity search because a narcotics dog falsely detected the presence of drugs on her body . While Pompa admits most crossers don \u2019 t undergo invasive searches , she believes not everyone has a pleasant experience . \u201c Verbal abuse , asking a lot of questions that are humiliating \u201d are the examples she provided .\nCustoms and Border Protection are just as concerned about the mistreatment of both legal border crossers and illegal immigrants . Unnamed officials told KTSM that if you believe you have been treated unfairly , there are a few things you can do . \u201c The best option\u2026speak to an on duty supervisor where the interaction occurred immediately , \u201d they explained . \u201c Or note the name of the officer , the date and time of the interaction , and exactly where it happened . \u201d\nIn practice , few illegal immigrants detained by U.S. authorities who truly believe they have been mistreated feel comfortable reporting wrongdoing , fearing they will be judged uncooperative and face deportation .\nLike any other law enforcement agency , the Border Patrol has officers who behave unprofessionally and inappropriately with detainees . However , instead of improving internal agency practices to prevent mistreatment of detainees , campaigns and pamphlets like these created by the ACLU can do more harm than good . Honest reports of mistreatment provide crucial feedback to CBP managers , but false reports \u2013 which could be exploited by groups like the ACLU for publicity \u2013 can damage CBP \u2019 s reputation , and ultimately prevent agents from doing their jobs .\nA small-scale effort like this one in El Paso is unlikely to cause a major shift in reporting of alleged abuses by illegal immigrants \u2013 or \u201c international commuters , \u201d as the ACLU refers to them \u2013 but it \u2019 s worth noting , in case this sort of campaign grows larger in the future .\nSylvia Longmire is a border security expert and Contributing Editor for Breitbart Texas .

        "topic": "Obama Attack Ad: Where Does Romney Stand on Immigration!?",
        "date": "2012-06-22",
        "content": "On Friday , Team Obama released the following advertisement criticizing former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney for not staking out a definitive position on the president \u2019 s controversial ( and unconstitutional ? ) executive order granting temporary status to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants .\nIn many ways this is a savvy political maneuver on the president \u2019 s part . Indeed , if Mitt Romney supports the executive order ( which , I think , will be interpreted as a form of amnesty ) he will no doubt alienate conservatives . On the other hand , if he explicitly opposes the order -- or vows to rescind it upon securing the presidency -- I suspect Hispanics will be less inclined to vote for him . This puts Team Romney in a precarious position , to be sure , forcing the campaign to address immigration reform much earlier than they may have originally anticipated . In any event , the presumptive Republican nominee did in fact address an audience of Latino lawmakers and elected officials yesterday in Florida , informing the American people precisely where he stands on the issue of immigration .\nThere are at least three crucial points Mitt Romney raised during his remarks . ( 1 ) President Obama had the opportunity ( and the means ) to tackle comprehensive immigration reform during his first presidential term . He failed . ( 2 ) The economic policies of the last three years have left the Hispanic community disproportionally unemployed ; in fact , 2.3 million more Hispanics now live in poverty . This , in effect , begs the all-important question : are Latino voters better off today than they were three and a half years ago ? ( 3 ) President Obama \u2019 s temporary solution to fixing our immigration woes ( i.e . his executive order ) is fundamentally flawed . For example , the parents of young illegal immigrants recently granted temporary status are still being deported from the country at increasingly alarming rates . Romney , by contrast , pledges to \u201c put in place his own long-term solution \u201d that , among other things , strengths legal immigration , secures the border , implements an employment verification system , and promotes strong families .\nIn sum , Governor Romney may have been hesitant -- even evasive -- over the last week or so , refusing to answer any questions directly regarding his position on the president \u2019 s controversial fiat . But now that he \u2019 s introduced his own sweeping reforms , however , it seems the Hispanic community is warming up to him . Remember , President Obama has already broken one solemn pledge to fix the nation \u2019 s broken immigration system . And so , given his horrendous track record -- and slew of broken campaign promises -- why should he be trusted now ? That 's a question every American should be asking themselves every day from now until November .",

        "topic": "As Government Misses Reunification Deadline, It\u2019s Told to Pick Up the Pace",
        "date": "",
        "content": "A federal judge Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to quicken its efforts to reunite migrant toddlers and infants with their parents , after the government said it wouldn \u2019 t meet an order that the judge called \u201c firm deadlines , not aspirational goals . \u201d\nFederal agencies said that by Tuesday they would only be able to reunite adults with 38 out of the 102 children under age 5 in the government \u2019 s care . The administration separated the children , and has been holding some since the spring , from their parents after the families crossed the border to enter the U.S. , many illegally .\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials said Tuesday that they would use monitoring tools including ankle bracelets to ensure that they maintained contact with the released parents of young children .\nJudge Dana Sabraw said the government should have been able to reconnect 63 eligible young migrant children with their families by day \u2019 s end . He told the American Civil Liberties Union to keep tabs on the government \u2019 s efforts and suggest punishment if attorneys believe officials are out of compliance .\nUnder a June court order , the judge told the administration to reunite the 2,000 to 3,000 detained children with their families following weeks of separation , with an early July deadline specifically for the youngest children .\nSome of the remaining reunions of young children couldn \u2019 t take place because the children \u2019 s parents have criminal records , communicable diseases or have been deemed otherwise unfit , the government said . The judge ordered regular progress reports from the government and set another hearing for Friday .\nThe Justice Department had argued that a federal law designed to avoid putting children in the custody of human traffickers had slowed the process of reunifying families . Judge Sabraw told the government to rely on a more streamlined method to reunite separated families than the labor-intensive and time-consuming process it had been following .\nAdvocates and agencies caring for the children described a last-ditch effort by the government to get the infants and toddlers reconnected with parents or adult sponsors . Travel arrangements presented hurdles . Information about where reunifications were happening was hard to come by .\nThe Tuesday deadline came after weeks of uncertainty over how the government would reunite the families . President Donald Trump signed an executive order in June stopping his own administration \u2019 s family separations under its \u201c zero-tolerance \u201d immigration policy .\nOn Monday , a judge in Los Angeles declined to consider changing a longstanding federal-court settlement that bars prolonged detention of immigrant children with their families . Scott Stewart , a Justice Department attorney , said he believed that court order , combined with the one ordering the children to be reunited by the end of the month , presented parents who illegally entered the country with a choice : Remain in custody after being reunited with their children or agree to release the kids to authorities to be placed with a sponsor .\nMeanwhile , reunions were happening on Tuesday . Near downtown Grand Rapids , Mich. , a car pulled up to a half-open garage in the back of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility , and two 3-year-old boys and a 4-year-old girl were quickly ushered out of the car to be reunited with their fathers . The children stayed inside the facility with their parents for about two hours .\nOne of the fathers , Ever Reyes Mejia , was reunited with his 3-year-old son after three months of separation , said his attorney , Abril Valdes , an immigrant-rights lawyer for the ACLU in Michigan . Mr. Mejia claimed asylum after entering the U.S. through a legal point of entry in McAllen , Texas , his lawyer said . They were detained together at a facility until one night , when agents separated them , the lawyer said . Mr. Mejia declined to comment .\nMs. Valdes said the father was crying , hugging and holding his son , caressing his face and assuring him they would never be separated again . She added that Mr. Mejia \u2019 s son had been so traumatized by the separation that he had stopped speaking .\n\u201c The boy is a shell of himself , \u201d Ms. Valdes said she was told , adding Mr. Mejia blames himself for his son \u2019 s pain .\nMr. Mejia , being tracked by an ankle bracelet , is staying in Michigan for now with his son and will face a hearing in Detroit later this month .\nElsewhere , an official from one children \u2019 s agency said only one of more than a dozen expected reunifications between migrant parents and young children in the agency \u2019 s care had taken place . Many others had been held up by delays in DNA testing .\nOfficials from the Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday at least 26 children were ineligible for reunification because DNA testing had revealed that adults weren \u2019 t biologically related to them , or the adults had criminal backgrounds , communicable diseases or accusations of child abuse , or were in custody .\nSilvia , a 25-year-old Guatemalan immigrant who illegally crossed the border , was hoping to reunite with her 3-year-old daughter on Tuesday , but confronted several obstacles . While the mother was staying with her sister in Chatsworth , Ga. , the girl was at a children \u2019 s facility in New York City .\nOn Tuesday afternoon , Silvia was trying to sort out whether someone would transport her daughter to Atlanta or whether she would need to travel to New York .\n\u201c I \u2019 m very worried , \u201d said Silvia , who declined to provide her last name . \u201c I don \u2019 t know what way they \u2019 re going to return her to me . \u201d\n\u2014Louise Radnofsky , Ian Lovett and Gerald Porter Jr. contributed to this article .",

        "date": "",
        "content": "Last week , Miriam Pallares boarded a bus in Oklahoma City with her six-year-old daughter and rode through the night to El Paso , Texas for a three-minute hug with family she hadn \u2019 t seen in years .\nThe mother and daughter were among 2,500 people participating in a rare event in which US Customs and Border Protection opens a gate in the fence separating El Paso from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez , Mexico , allowing families to briefly reunify . Hugs Not Walls , or Abrazos No Muros , was started in the spring of 2016 by non-profit Border Network for Human Rights . It takes place roughly twice a year , when the water flow of the Rio Grande is cut to a trickle . Families on either side of the border wait in line for hours to embrace for three minutes in the dry riverbed .\nFor many , the event marks the first\u2014and last\u2014time they will have physical contact with family members for years .\nBy 7:00 a.m. , hundreds of participants had formed a line that curled around El Paso \u2019 s unassuming Chihuahuita Park . Over blue shirts required for participation , they bundled in coats and blankets , some toting folding chairs and coolers of lunch . Kids ran around the playground , blue shirts reaching their knees . 800 feet away\u2014across train tracks , the soaring border fence and the shallow Rio Grande\u2014corresponding families gathered at an intersection in Ju\u00e1rez , wearing white shirts .\nMiriam , a 27-year-old with bright pink lipstick and an impeccable ponytail , had been anticipating this day ever since she learned about the event on Facebook a couple years ago . \u201c I really want to see my sister\u2014it \u2019 s been four years since I saw her , \u201d she explained in Spanish . \u201c She can \u2019 t come here because she hasn \u2019 t been able to get her visa , and I still haven \u2019 t gotten my asylum . I \u2019 m fighting to get it . \u201d\nAt 8:00 , the line in the park began to move . Some pushed wheelchairs or strollers as they made their way towards a dirt opening next to the border fence . There , participants waited for hours on plastic chairs : Only 20 families could enter through the gate at a time . Miriam was number 82 .\nAs she sat , Miriam exchanged texts and photos with her sister , aunts , and nieces , who waited in Ju\u00e1rez . Her daughter Mairim , a bubbly first grader , danced , collected rocks , and eagerly took our microphone and played reporter , asking about our family members : What are their names ? Where do they live ?\nMiriam and Mairim ( \u201c Miriam \u201d spelled backwards ) left Juarez four years ago after receiving threats from a drug cartel . They settled in Oklahoma City , where Miriam sells burritos and tacos out of a food truck .\nAt 10:30 , when families 81 to 100 were called on a loudspeaker , Miriam and Mairim lined up next to the border fence . Behind them was a woman who , with the exception of last year \u2019 s Hugs Not Walls , hadn \u2019 t seen her 36-year-old son in more than a decade . Ahead of them was mom with blotchy cheeks and teary eyes who hadn \u2019 t seen her own mother in eleven years . Mairim played with other kids in line , reaching small hands through the border fence and trying to spot family on the other side . She couldn \u2019 t recall meeting the relatives in person , but recognized them from years of video calls .\nHugs Not Walls is a logistical jigsaw puzzle , requiring sign-off from CBP , the International Water Commission , local law enforcement , and federal police in Mexico . It \u2019 s also subject to changes in the political climate : Last May , as the number of migrants at the border reached a record high , the event was abruptly cancelled . \u201c Every time we do this , it could be the last one , \u201d explained Fernando Garcia , director of the Border Network for Human Rights . \u201c Having children in cages like that\u2014or in a makeshift detention camp\u2014under a bridge , all of that situation created a very tense relationship with CBP , \u201d he added .\nMario Escalante , a US Border Patrol spokesperson , explained that the agency wasn \u2019 t able to support last May \u2019 s event . Still , Border Patrol maintained a light presence on Saturday , with just a couple of officers on site but with surveillance cameras looking over the event . \u201c For us it \u2019 s business as usual : Maintain border security , \u201d said Escalante . A similar event has been taking place at the border between Tijuana and San Diego since 2013 .\nAfter what felt to Miriam like an eternity of waiting , volunteers led the group down a concrete levy to the river . Mairim held her mother \u2019 s hand as she walked , waving enthusiastically to relatives walking down the levy \u2019 s south side . Miriam captured the moment on Facebook live .\nOne by one , those in blue shirts crossed a narrow , dusty plywood bridge into the dry riverbed on the Mexican side . They were assigned to line up as if starting a race , blue-shirted shoulder to blue-shirted shoulder , waiting for a man with a loudspeaker to tell them to hug . Ten feet away , those with white shirts did the same . Seeing her aunt just steps away , Mairim exclaimed , \u201c T\u00eda ! \u201d and broke into a run before the organizer instructed , \u201c Not yet ! \u201d For a few tense seconds , the families stood looking at each other , separated only by a bit of cracked dirt .\nWhen the organizer yelled , \u201c Hug ! \u201d the wailing was immediate . Families collapsed into each others \u2019 arms . Mairim would later say that she was \u201c so excited to get hugging. \u201d But in the moment , she stood in the middle of a group embrace , weeping . Feet away , other families went through the same routine of hugs , selfies , more hugs , more crying . Cameramen zoomed in on sobbing faces . Along the levy , stoic Mexican police officers looked on . Mairim \u2019 s aunt picked her up and wiped the tears from beneath her niece \u2019 s pink glasses , joking that she had finally made it to Mexico .\nAt 10:53 , the organizer yelled , \u201c Time \u2019 s up ! \u201d and , after final hugs , lines formed again . Blue shirts walked up the levy walkway to El Paso as white shirts walked up the levy to Ju\u00e1rez . Many participants looked gutted and dazed , like they had just run a marathon . \u201c Bye , T\u00eda ! \u201d Mairim yelled as she wearily waved to her family . \u201c I love you ! \u201d\nA few hours later , the mother and daughter would board a bus for Oklahoma City . But first , the pair sat once again on the plastic chairs , waiting for permission to leave . Miriam couldn \u2019 t stop smiling . She wished she had more time with family , she said , but she was thankful for those three minutes . Sitting next to her mom , a resigned Mairim stared down at her lap , lips quivering .",

        "date": "2013-05-01",
        "content": "In an immigration reform debate loaded with bitter disputes , there \u2019 s vast bipartisan support for a small , as-yet-overlooked part of the Senate \u2019 s bipartisan legislation : doing more to integrate new immigrants into American civic and cultural life .\nBeneficiaries of such assimilation efforts would be brand new immigrants , as well as those who have lived illegally in America for years but who , under immigration reform , are seeking legal status and , some , eventual citizenship .\n\u201c I appreciate the attention given in the bill to expanding resources for improving assimilation and the integration of immigrants in our society , especially in terms of promoting English-language and civics education , \u201d said Sen. John Cornyn ( R ) of Texas , a skeptic of the overall immigration package , at a hearing on the immigration reform bill last week .\nWhere will the millions of hours of English-language instruction that the undocumented will need , if they are to obtain green cards , come from ? ask advocates for immigrants . And with the prospect of perhaps 10 million illegal immigrants moving along the road to citizenship over the next decade , where will communities look for resources and best practices to begin to bring them out of the shadows and into community life ? they wonder .\nToday , America \u2019 s immigrant integration system is best known for letting local groups help new immigrants in ways unique to their communities . What current integration efforts don \u2019 t do , however , is deliver any comprehensive strategy for ensuring that new Americans get a firm rooting in their wider , new communities .\nSome conservative immigration analysts point to the specter of the Boston Marathon bombings , allegedly conducted by two young men admitted to the US as child refugees , as evidence that the nation \u2019 s system of \u201c patriotic assimilation \u201d is due for an overhaul .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very striking to see there \u2019 s almost nothing intentional the federal government does to ensure immigrant integration . It mostly leaves the integration process to chance , leaves it to states and localities to figure out , '' says Margie McHugh , co-director of the Migration Policy Institute \u2019 s National Center on Immigrant Integration Policy . `` This kind of made sense 100 years ago . It certainly is an unintelligent and unstrategic [ approach ] for this day and age . \u201d\nThe Senate bill , whose section on integration spans some 30 pages of a piece of legislation that is more than 800 pages , proposes several steps to help form a more comprehensive integration strategy :\nThe bill strengthens an existing office within the Department of Homeland Security charged with overseeing immigrant integration efforts by providing it funding for full-time staff , rather than employees loaned from other departments .\nIt charges that office with establishing national immigrant integration goals and offers an additional $ 20 million a year in funding for grants aimed at improving assimilation and citizenship efforts . Currently , the government spends about $ 5 million to $ 10 million a year on such grants .\nThe legislation sets up a new public-private foundation , led by the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services , which oversees the naturalization process , to help fund integration efforts with corporate donations .\nFinally , it restarts a task force on new Americans first created by President George W. Bush , with a mandate to produce a report within three years on recommended changes to immigration policy to encourage integration .\nWhat that amounts to , says a Senate Democratic aide who worked on the integration provisions in the bill , is \u201c a more proactive and constructive integration policy than we \u2019 ve had in the past , where we \u2019 re actually proactively thinking , \u2018 How do we best use this human capital to our country \u2019 s advantage ? \u2019 \u201d\nWhat does that add up to in practice ? Many different things for different communities , Senate aides and immigrant advocates say . Some locales will be able to expand mentorship programs , in which a native-born American helps a prospective citizen figure out the local PTA or study for the citizenship exam . Other communities could provide better coordination of information on issues such as GED classes or small-business loans .\nWhat it does n't add up to are answers for some of the integration system 's pressing questions . The $ 20 million annual grants , for example , wo n't begin to touch even the English-language skills requirement , Ms. McHugh says .\nImmigration reformers , then , hang their hopes on the new foundation the law would establish to generate private funding for programs when a financially strapped federal government can not foot the bill .\nSeveral corporations `` have expressed huge interest in working with [ the US Citizenship and Immigration Services ] to provide money to nonprofits and local communities in order to teach English , '' among other initiatives , `` because they see it as advantageous to themselves , '' says the Senate aide . `` They understand the value of their workers understanding English and integrating into local communities . ''\nThose who will be handling the bumper group of prospective Americans see the legislation in much the same way .\nThe bill is not a \u201c sea change \u201d in the US government \u2019 s efforts on integration , says Stacy Martin , a spokesperson for Lutheran Immigrant Relief Services , one of seven organizations that resettle refugees in the US .\nInstead , the bill shows \u201c an understanding that you don \u2019 t take a test and automatically see yourself as a full part of the community , \u201d says Ms. Martin . \u201c If we \u2019 re going to be successful as a country , across every sector ... then everyone needs a path to engagement . \u201d\nEven before a wave of potential new citizens , some advocates worry that the US isn \u2019 t doing enough to bring residents of the United States into the fullness of citizenship . Currently , there are more than 13.5 million legal permanent residents of the US , according to DHS statistics from 2011 , the most recent data available . More than 8 million of those are eligible for citizenship , according to the same stats . The US offers about a million people permanent residence in the US every year .\n\u201c We \u2019 re losing something when we have people who have not actually gotten through the process of becoming citizens , \u201d says a Senate Democratic aide who worked on the integration portion of the bill . \u201c When they do take that last step , there \u2019 s even a higher level of investment in our country when you become a citizen . \u201d\nGetting new Americans that path is something that immigration reform advocates see as a key selling point of the bill .\n\u201c In 2007 , and even today , the sources of opposition to immigration reform is sometimes economic but its also cultural fear that immigrants aren \u2019 t assimilating , that they aren \u2019 t learning English , \u201d says Kevin Appleby , director of refugee and migration policy at the US Conference of Catholic Bishops . \u201c We \u2019 ve always pressed that integration is the antidote to that cultural fear . \u201d\nBut that \u2019 s where bipartisan accord around immigrant integration breaks down \u2013 and does not appear anywhere near strong enough to pull the bill along on its own .\nAdvocates like Mr. Appleby believe that \u201c the strongest integration policy is bringing people out of the shadows , \u201d that keeping more than 10 million undocumented people in the country without access to engagement with American civic culture is unbearable .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
