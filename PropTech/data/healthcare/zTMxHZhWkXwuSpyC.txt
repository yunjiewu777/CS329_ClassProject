Almost 80 million people with employer health plans could find their coverage canceled because they are not compliant with ObamaCare , several experts predicted .
Their losses would be in addition to the millions who found their individual coverage cancelled for the same reason .
Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise Institute said that in addition to the individual cancellations , `` at least half the people on employer plans would by 2014 start losing plans as well . '' There are approximately 157 million employer health care policy holders .
Avik Roy of the Manhattan Institute added , `` the administration estimated that approximately 78 million Americans with employer sponsored insurance would lose their existing coverage due to the Affordable Care Act . ''
Last week , an analysis by the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think tank , showed the administration anticipates half to two-thirds of small businesses would have policies canceled or be compelled to send workers onto the ObamaCare exchanges . They predicted up to 100 million small and large business policies could be canceled next year .
According to projections the administration itself issued back in July 2010 , it was clear officials knew the impact of ObamaCare three years ago .
In fact , according to the Federal Register , its mid-range estimate was that by the end of 2014 , 76 percent of small group plans would be cancelled , along with 55 percent of large employer plans .
The reason behind the losses is that current plans do n't meet the requirements of ObamaCare , which dictate that each plan must cover a list of essential benefits , whether people want them or not .
`` Things like maternity care or acupuncture or extensive drug coverage , '' said Veuger . `` And so now the law is going to force them to buy policies that they could have gotten in the past if they wanted to but they chose not to . ''
Some plans already have been canceled and employers are getting sticker shock at the new , higher prices under ObamaCare .
One of them is David Allen , president of a company bearing his name in Boulder , Colorado . He told a Congressional hearing recently that his carrier discontinued his company policy because it was n't compliant with ObamaCare .
`` It does not meet the minimum standards as stipulated under the law . Due to this one change , '' he said , `` our premiums are now scheduled to increase by 52.3 percent in January 2014 . ''
Roy said that is not unusual . `` The old plans that are being cancelled are meaningfully cheaper than the new plans that are ObamaCare compliant . ''
A new wave of cancellations and sticker shock will emerge just before next year 's elections .
`` They 're going to start doing that in the summer or early fall but certainly before the midterm elections , '' said Veuger .
