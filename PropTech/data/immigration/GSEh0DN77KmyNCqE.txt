In hopes of cutting down on fraud and abuse , Attorney General Bill Barr has implemented a new ruling requiring that individuals seeking asylum in the United States be held in detention facilities until their court date . Essentially , Barr is ending catch-and-release of those claiming asylum .

As a reminder , the vast majority of asylum claims are thrown out and `` credible fear '' or `` reasonable fear '' statements are fraudulently used to gain access to the United States . A reminder from the White House :
-There has been a massive spike in migrants claiming asylum at the border regardless of whether their claims have merit or not .
-Prior to 2013 , 1 out of every 100 aliens arriving at the border claimed credible fear and sought asylum . That number has skyrocketed to 1 out of every 10 .
-Less than 10 percent of those who were granted credible fear in 2018 were ultimately approved for asylum .
-Capacity at immigration facilities has been pushed to its limit , driving our already broken system from “ catch-and-release ” to just release .
-Congress needs to fix our asylum laws by raising the credible fear standard and tightening eligibility to prevent abuse of the system .
-Currently , migrants with meritless claims often cross the border illegally , claim “ credible fear , ” and gain release into the interior of the country .
Currently , the asylum backlog sits at nearly 500,000 cases with an additional 348,000 individuals waiting in the immigration court system .
`` Lengthy backlogs in asylum processing undermine the integrity of the asylum system . They delay legal protection for individuals who are legitimately fleeing persecution and have valid asylum claims . Further , such delays are a 'pull factor ' for illegal immigration , '' a report from the State Department details . `` By providing protection from removal , they create an incentive for those without lawful status to enter and remain in the United States . Asylum applicants also are eligible to obtain employment authorization after their asylum applications have been pending for six months , creating an incentive to file frivolous or fraudulent asylum applications . ''
The Senate Judiciary Committee is also working on legislation to address the asylum issue .
