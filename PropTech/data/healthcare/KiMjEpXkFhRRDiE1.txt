The battle for universal healthcare is not over . This is not because of the reason you might suspect – that Republicans will obstinately endeavor to obstruct Obamacare in every way they can ( though that seems to be the case ) . Instead , even after the smoke clears from the government shutdown ( presumably with the law intact ) , the battle over universal healthcare will still not be over , but for a more fundamental reason : Obamacare , whatever its advantages ( and despite the right 's worst fears ) , does not create a system of universal healthcare .
Now first , to be clear , this is not to say that Obama ’ s Affordable Care Act won ’ t help many people . The uninsured who become eligible for coverage through the expansion of Medicaid , for example , will of course be better off – assuming they don ’ t live in one of the 20 or more states that have callously elected to deny them this potentially lifesaving opportunity . Additionally , many uninsured who were previously unable to afford private health insurance may now be able to do so , for instance through the new income-based premium subsidies . And most of us will benefit from many of the law ’ s insurance reforms , like the one that prevents insurers ’ from denying us coverage because we are sick .
And at the same time , have no doubt : The various Republican alternatives for American healthcare would be disastrous . Consider the most recent GOP healthcare proposal H.R . 3121 , which would gut state insurance regulations , eliminate popular ACA reforms like the ban on “ preexisting conditions , ” end the Medicaid expansion , and provide tax benefits that would preferentially benefit the wealthy , among other unhelpful proposals that would do nothing to help the uninsured . Conservative “ consumer-driven ” healthcare dreams , more generally , would in truth be nightmares , radically furthering the transformation of healthcare into yet another commodity , bought by “ consumers ” in proportion to their means , not provided to patients on the basis of their needs .
Yet these facts do n't change the fundamental fact that the ACA will not create what so many of us want , what the right so fervently fears , and – most important – what so many people really need : true universal healthcare . Why ?
First , on a basic level , the ACA is not universal healthcare because though it will reduce uninsurance , it won ’ t provide universal coverage . According to the Congressional Budget Office ’ s May 2013 estimates , even by 2020 some 30 million Americans will be left uninsured under the ACA , a number that can only be partially attributed to intransigent Republican state governments that have blocked the expansion of Medicaid in their states .
But even putting aside those 30 million people , the ACA is insufficient because it will not deliver what most of us think of as universal healthcare : a system of equitable and comprehensive care for all , with full protection against the cost of illness . Indeed , on the contrary , underway already is a “ quiet revolution ” in American healthcare , in the words of Dr. Drew Altman of the Kaiser Foundation , that moves us “ from more comprehensive to less comprehensive ” health insurance , with patients paying more and more out of pocket every time they get sick . Ironically , even with the ACA going into full effect , “ the vision of insurance that they ’ ve [ conservatives ] always favored , ” as Altman told the New York Times , “ with more skin in the game , is the one that ’ s coming to dominate in the marketplace . ”
The data clearly show , for instance , that with each passing year , more and more of the insured are already paying higher and higher deductibles , co-pays , and co-insurance whenever they actually need to use their expensive insurance ( despite unsurprising evidence that rising out-of-pocket expenses can deter people from seeking needed medical care ) . In another disturbing trend , major employers – including Walgreens , Sears and Darden restaurants – seem to be moving away from “ fixed benefit ” health insurance to “ fixed contribution ” plans , in which employees receive a lump sum to buy a healthcare plan , with no guarantee that these contributions will keep up with the cost of health insurance in future years . It should be noted that this “ quiet revolution ” toward higher out-of-pocket expenses and more limited benefits is not of the ACA ’ s making . At the same time , however , the ACA will do little to reverse it ( and , in the case of the new excise tax on “ Cadillac ” healthcare plans , may even exacerbate it ) .
Meanwhile , for those not insured by their employer and who buy health insurance on the state exchanges that opened on Oct. 1 , “ underinsurance ” may very well become the norm . The plans on the exchanges will be offered in tiers , with the lowest level – the Bronze plan – only required to have an actuarial value of 60 percent ( that is to say , the percent of your average annual healthcare expenses that insurance actually pays for ) , with out-of-pocket annual expenses ( after your premium is paid ) reaching as high as $ 12,700 a year for families ( depending on income ) . Moreover , to keep premiums in check , many of these plans will have significantly limited networks of doctors and hospitals , bringing back memories of 1990s managed care . In Missouri , for instance , the Anthem BlueCross BlueShield Plans sold on the exchange will exclude one of the state ’ s top hospital systems , thereby denying access to the state ’ s primary academic medical center and its prominent children ’ s hospital .
Finally , the ACA most likely won ’ t significantly bend the overall cost curve of healthcare , mainly because it will more or less leave our existing , fragmented and inefficient system in place . According to the most recent projections , for instance , once the economy recovers , the rate of growth of national health expenditures is expected to rebound to about 6 percent annually . This is better than in some previous years , and in an expanding economy in which growth was being distributed throughout the pay scale , might be entirely acceptable . But insofar as these rising costs continue to be passed on to the average working person – while at the same time gains in economic growth continue to accrue solely to the most affluent among us – these rising expenses will simply translate into tighter and tighter household budgets , and therefore even more inequality .
So while what the right says about Obamacare is generally wrong , paranoid or both , and though their own proposals would clearly make things much worse , we can ’ t pretend that Obamacare will create universal healthcare in the sense that most of us imagine it . We won ’ t have , that is to say , truly comprehensive healthcare for all , with free choice of doctor and hospital , and without a “ sickness tax ” in the form of out-of-pocket expenses every time we become ill .
What would a system of true universal healthcare look like ? The most feasible and best-studied system for the United States is a form of national health insurance called “ single payer , ” in which care would be provided by the same mixture of private and public hospitals and physicians that is already in place , but in which a single entity – the government – insures everyone in the country . Medicare is one example of an existing single-payer system , but under a national single-payer system , everyone – not only the elderly – would be covered . Uninsurance would thereby be finally , and entirely , eliminated .
From a quality perspective , the evidence suggests that universal systems perform better – not worse , as is frequently alleged . A January 2013 report from the National Research Council , for instance , showed that the U.S. has essentially the worst health outcomes among 16 wealthy “ peer nations , ” despite spending about twice as much on healthcare .
Such a system would have other advantages as well . For instance , it would drastically reduce our massive and rising expenditure on healthcare administration , which in 1999 accounted for an estimated 31 percent of all healthcare spending in the U.S. , as opposed to a mere 7 percent in Canada . This difference is the predictable result of our highly complex and fragmented system of billing and insurance , which is particularly a problem of the private health insurance industry , which has such additional costs as product design , marketing and profits . Indeed , as much as 85 percent of excess spending on “ health administration and insurance ” is attributable to the private health insurance system . How , exactly , the health insurance industry contributes to actual healthcare – putting aside its extracting role as unnecessary middleman – remains among the great mysteries of the modern age .
The potential windfall from simplifying this mess could therefore be enormous . According to one recent study , a single-payer system could save the federal government about $ 592 billion a year . These savings could be used to pay for the cost of eliminating both uninsurance and underinsurance , with everyone receiving comprehensive healthcare without onerous co-pays and deductibles every time they got sick .
Such a system might sound like a dream for some , but it ’ s not only a dream worth fighting for , but also one that can – with time and determination – be won . The fight for universal healthcare , it is clear , is still far from over : A new stage of that fight , in fact , has only just begun .
