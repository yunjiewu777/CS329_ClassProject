Hospitals are threatening to fire health-care workers who publicize their working conditions during the coronavirus pandemic -- and have in some cases followed through .
Ming Lin , an emergency room physician in Washington state , said he was told Friday he was out of a job because he ’ d given an interview to a newspaper about a Facebook post detailing what he believed to be inadequate protective equipment and testing . In Chicago , a nurse was fired after emailing colleagues that she wanted to wear a more protective mask while on duty . In New York , the NYU Langone Health system has warned employees they could be terminated if they talk to the media without authorization .
“ Hospitals are muzzling nurses and other health-care workers in an attempt to preserve their image , ” said Ruth Schubert , a spokeswoman for the Washington State Nurses Association . “ It is outrageous . ”
Hospitals have traditionally had strict media guidelines to protect patient privacy , urging staff to talk with journalists only through official public relations offices . But the pandemic has ushered in a new era , Schubert said .
Health-care workers “ must have the ability to tell the public what is really going on inside the facilities where they are caring for Covid-19 patients , ” she said .
One reason is to prepare other nurses and doctors for the looming onslaught of cases and encourage donations of much-needed equipment , particularly the personal protective equipment or PPE that protects them from being infected and in turn infecting other patients as well as their families when they go home .
In China , one of the earliest alarms about the mysterious new illness was raised by a doctor in an online chatroom in late December . He was reprimanded and forced to sign a police statement that the post was illegal . He later contracted the disease from a patient and died .

“ It is good and appropriate for health-care workers to be able to express their own fears and concerns , especially when expressing that might get them better protection , ” said Glenn Cohen , faculty director of Harvard Law School ’ s bioethics center . It ’ s likely hospitals are trying to limit reputational damage because “ when health-care workers say they are not being protected , the public gets very upset at the hospital system . ”
Doctors are a famously independent profession , where individual medical judgment on what ’ s best for the patient is prized over administrative dictates . That ’ s reared its head during the Covid-19 outbreak , with many physicians , nurses and other health-care workers taking to social media to express deep concerns about the lack of protective gear or much-needed patient-care equipment like respirators . Some posts have gone viral and are being shared hundreds of thousands of times , often tagged with # GetMePPE . Privacy laws prohibit disclosing specific patient information , but they don ’ t bar discussing general working conditions .

NYU Langone Health employees received a notice Friday from Kathy Lewis , executive vice president of communications , saying that anyone who talked to the media without authorization would be “ subject to disciplinary action , including termination . ”
Jim Mandler , a spokesman for NYU Langone Health , said the policy was to protect patient and staff confidentiality . “ Because information is constantly evolving , it is in the best interest of our staff and the institution that only those with the most updated information are permitted to address these issues with the media . ”
New York ’ s Montefiore Health System requires staff get permission before speaking publicly , and sent a reminder in a March 17 newsletter that all media requests “ must be shared and vetted ” by the public relations department .
“ Associates are not authorized to interact with reporters or speak on behalf of the institution in any capacity , without pre-approval , ” according to the policy , which was seen by ███ News .
Lauri Mazurkiewicz , the Chicago nurse who was fired by Northwestern Memorial Hospital after urging colleagues to wear more protective equipment , has filed a wrongful termination lawsuit .
“ A lot of hospitals are lying to their workers and saying that simple masks are sufficient and nurses are getting sick and they are dying , ” she said .
Mazurkiewicz , 46 , has asthma and cares for her father , who suffers from a respiratory disease . At 75 , he ’ s in one of the most at-risk groups of dying from the virus . “ I didn ’ t want to get infected because I ’ m not wearing the proper mask and then spread it to my patients and my family , ” she said .
A Northwestern Memorial Hospital spokesperson declined to comment , citing the lawsuit . The hospital said in an emailed statement that it “ is committed to the safety of our employees . ”

Charles Prosper , chief executive of PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center ’ s Northwest network where Lin worked in Bellingham , said in an email that Lin was “ publicly critical ” of the hospital ’ s readiness to deal with patients . Lin ’ s contract is through TeamHealth , which said it ’ s seeking to find him new work .
“ Our oath is to do no harm , ” Lin said . “ I spoke out for patient safety and as a result I got terminated . ”
Not all hospitals are blocking staff from talking to the press . New York ’ s Mount Sinai has been scheduling media interviews for nurses , physicians and trainees to help the public understand the severity of the crisis , a spokesperson said in an emailed statement . The University of California San Francisco Medical Center has gotten hundreds of such calls and encouraged workers to talk to reporters .
Nisha Mehta is a 38-year radiologist from Charlotte , North Carolina , who runs two Facebook groups for physicians with around 70,000 members . She ’ s fielded numerous requests from health-care workers hoping to get their stories into the public arena .
“ I ’ m hearing widespread stories from physicians across the country and they are all saying : ‘ We have these stories that we think are important to get out , but we are being told by our hospital systems that we are not allowed to speak to the press , and if we do so there will be extreme consequences , ” she said .
Many say they get daily emails urging them not to talk to the media under any circumstances . “ The public needs to hear these stories and other physicians need to hear them to be warned against what ’ s coming , ” Mehta said . “ It ’ s so important that everyone understands how bad this is going to get . ”
