A six-year-old boy in Spain is currently in intensive care after coming down with the country 's first case of diphtheria in 28 years . Diphtheria is a disease that has long been eradicated from most of the western world thanks to widespread vaccination programs , but has re-surged in areas like post-Soviet Russia , with fractured medical systems . While Spain has a widespread ( and free ! ) vaccination program , the sick six-year-old was not vaccinated against diphtheria as his parents do not believe in vaccines .
According to Time , Spanish doctors had a hard time finding appropriate treatment for diphtheria because it had been so long since they have had to treat the disease .
The child is currently being treated with an anti-toxin in Barcelona , but the drug was not easy to find , El País reports . The country ’ s Health Ministry appealed to the World Health Organization and authorities in the U.S. before finally locating a dose in Russia . “ The problem is that these days , no one has this illness . Everyone is vaccinated , ” general secretary for the health service , Rubén Moreno , told El País . The Russian ambassador to Spain brought the drug by plane from Moscow early Monday . Caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae , diphtheria most frequently infects adults over 60 and children under five . It is spread both through the air and via direct contact and can cause heart problems , nerve damage and severe respiratory distress .
The parents of the sickened Spanish boy say they feel `` tricked '' by anti-vaccination groups who persuaded them to skip vaccinating their son .
“ The family is devastated and admit that they feel tricked , because they were not properly informed , ” said Catalan public health chief Antoni Mateu . “ They have a deep sense of guilt , which we are trying to rid them of . ”
Eight other children in Spain have been found to have been infected with the diphtheria bacteria , but as they have been vaccinated against it they have not developed the same life-threatening symptoms as the six-year-old boy .
To put the amount of time between Spain 's last diphtheria case and now into context , I turn 24 years old tomorrow . Spain had n't had a case of diphtheria in my entire lifetime until this case was discovered at the end of last month . This is a massive step back in public health . As I 've written before , diphtheria used to be a widespread and deadly disease that killed nearly 10 percent of those afflicted . Less than a century ago , thousands of children , including my 13-year-old great aunt , were sickened and died during the diphtheria epidemic of 1921 in the United States . Thanks to the introduction of the diphtheria vaccine , diphtheria is no longer something that most parents have to worry about . However , if a parent refuses to let their child receive these potentially lifesaving vaccinations , they are needlessly putting them at risk .
