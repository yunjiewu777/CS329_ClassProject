US life expectancy fell last year for a second year running for the first time in more than half a century , reportedly driven by the worsening opioid crisis .
Life expectancy in 2016 fell 0.1 years to 78.6 , according to the National Center for Health Statistics .
It was the first consecutive drop since 1962-63 . The last two-year decline before that was in the 1920s .
The previous fall in overall US life expectancy was a one-year drop in 1993 , at the height of the Aids epidemic .
Years of over-prescription of opioid painkillers in the US has created a nationwide addiction crisis , with patients turning to heroin and other street drugs when their prescriptions stop .
`` The key factor in all this is the increase in drug overdose deaths , '' said Robert Anderson , the chief of mortality statistics at the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) , calling the two-year life expectancy drop `` shocking '' .
In 2016 , 63,600 people died from a drug overdose , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) - up 21 % from the previous year and three times the rate in 1999 .
Opioid-related overdoses increased by 28 % , killing 42,249 people , mostly in the 25-to-54 age group .
The 0.1-year overall drop in 2016 stems from a 0.2-year drop among men and no change among women , whose life expectancy at birth stayed at 81.1 .
A life expectancy drop again in 2017 would represent the first three-year fall since the catastrophic outbreak of Spanish flu 100 years ago .
Behind the dramatic increase in overdoses among heroin users are synthetic opioids such as fentanyl , which has flooded the US market and is 100 times more powerful than heroin .
Many users unknowingly inject heroin that has been cut with fentanyl , leaving them with no control over the strength of the hit they take .
Overdoses from synthetic opioids jumped to 19,410 in 2016 from 9,580 in 2015 , according to the CDC . There were 15,500 heroin-related deaths in 2016 , up from 12,989 the previous year .
Death rates fell for seven of the 10 leading causes of death , including heart disease , cancer , stroke and diabetes . offsetting the increase in overdoses .
`` If those had n't declined to the extent they did then of course things would look worse , '' said Mr Anderson .
The 2016 death rate increased 9.7 % for unintentional injuries , 3.1 % for Alzheimer 's - partly due to an aging population - and 1.5 % for suicide .
In a separate report , the CDC linked a 133 % increase in hepatitis C cases between 2004 and 2014 to the increase in users injecting opioids .
In October , President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency .
He stopped short of declaring a national emergency , which would have freed up more federal funds to combat the crisis .
