That I was more resilient and adaptive than I thought I was . Even the anxious New York human can adapt to an unusual situation .
How is a bunker different than staying put in a one-bedroom apartment ?
We are not in a bunker situation . We have proper water and electricity . We ’ re living in well-equipped spaces . Sheltering means right now , you don ’ t have freedom of movement . You ’ re spending most of your time here . Your world has been constricted to a very small living space . You have a toilet ; you ’ re not using a plastic bag with cat litter in it .
What are the five most important things , outside of food , that you need for survival in a New York apartment ?
Medicine : a month ’ s worth of prescriptions and over-the-counter items like allergy , aspirin , cold and flu , Imodium , and an emergency first-aid kit with gauze , tape , ointment for burns , a tourniquet , and plastic gloves .
Each crisis has its own particulars — the electricity is unlikely to fail in this situation . That said , it ’ s always good to have spare batteries and flashlights in the house , but I wouldn ’ t start panicking and rushing out and getting them now if you don ’ t already have them . Five thousand dollars in cash , or look at your monthly budget and double that .
Also : Something to amuse and distract yourself : reading material , videos , board games . A way to exercise in the house : yoga , resistance bands , and weights . We need a way to work off the stress . Put together all your financial documents in one place , along with a contact list of everyone you might need to call in case of an emergency . There should also be a point of contact person who knows all of your passwords . Right now my husband and I are revisiting our wills , just in case .
