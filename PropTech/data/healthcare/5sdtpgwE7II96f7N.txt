In the past , if lawmakers did nothing in the open enrollment period , their coverage would automatically continue . This year , by contrast , they must affirmatively pick a plan . Their coverage under the federal employee program will end on Dec. 31 . If they do not choose a plan via D.C. Health Link by Dec. 9 , they will lose the government contribution to their premiums and could lose their right to retiree health benefits as well .
In addition , lawmakers who go without insurance next year may , like other Americans , be subject to tax penalties .
Some congressional aides , especially older employees who face higher premiums , are unhappy about the changes . But some who carefully compare their options on the exchange find that they can save money .
Jacqueline A. Thomas , a 26-year-old legislative correspondent for Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz , Democrat of Florida , said she was able to reduce her monthly premium to $ 60 , from $ 120 , by switching to a Kaiser plan from a Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan .
“ I ’ ll be paying half as much for comparable coverage , ” she said .
The congressional work force is full of young , healthy people like Ms. Thomas , precisely the type of customer insurers want to attract .
Congressional aides naturally have a few complaints . Some are confused by the large number of options . When they sign up for a plan online , they get no confirmation , so they are apprehensive . In addition , the website for the local exchange does not display the government contribution for members of Congress and their aides .
It shows , for example , that a couple with one child may pay $ 1,300 a month for a plan , when , in fact , their share of the premium is only $ 352 ; the government pays $ 948 . Local exchange officials said their website had not been set up to calculate premium contributions using the formula required for lawmakers and other federal employees .
