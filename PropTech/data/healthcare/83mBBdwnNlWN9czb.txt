Obamacare opponents have been on a losing streak in federal courts over the past year , suffering setbacks as judges have ruled against them on challenges to the health care law ’ s constitutionality and efforts to carve out protections from its birth control rules on faith-based employers .
The opponents — chiefly Republicans and their allies — hope for a reversal of fortune next month when the Supreme Court decides a major case on Obamacare ’ s subsidies .
The 2010 law spawned an entire line of litigation that has reached the Supreme Court three times and gone through myriad appeals courts . Until recently , rulings could be predicted reliably based on whether the judges were appointed by Democrats or Republicans .
Until a year ago , Democratic appointees ruled in favor of Obamacare more than 90 percent of the time , while Republican appointees ruled against the law nearly 80 percent of the time , according to a ███ review of substantive federal appellate opinions on the Affordable Care Act .
But as the weighty constitutional issues have been settled and the cases turn to more technical matters , that ratio is changing . Democrat-appointed judges continue to uphold the law , backing it 19 out of 20 times in rulings over the past year . But Republican judges have broken ranks , with six of the 10 to rule on Obamacare supporting the administration ’ s interpretation of the law and thwarting challenges .
Appellate courts have turned back lawsuits that complain that the Affordable Care Act set up Medicare “ death panels , ” had been drafted in the wrong chamber of Congress or bestowed special favors to Capitol Hill employees . In many cases , they found plaintiffs couldn ’ t prove they were harmed by Obamacare .
A reason for the change could be that recent cases are more technical and delve into intricacies of the law ’ s origin and wording , whereas earlier challenges centered on major philosophical questions of government power , with which judges were more likely to differ based on ideology .
“ I don ’ t think there ’ s any question that ideology influences decisions on the less-technical and more-political of legal decisions , ” said Evan Lee , a professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law , citing Obamacare and abortion cases as examples .
Although a judge ’ s nominating party influences only so much , he said , appointees don ’ t always turn out as presidents plan , and judges tend to have “ idiosyncrasies ” that emphasize certain rights or other aspects of jurisprudence .
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. devastated conservatives when he upheld Obamacare ’ s individual mandate requiring Americans to hold insurance as constitutional under Congress taxation authority . Meanwhile , two Democratic appointees to the court — Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen G. Breyer — dealt the administration a blow by holding that states could decide not to expand Medicaid without risking existing federal funding for the program .
Democrat-appointed judges or justices have decided against Obamacare three times in 47 rulings since 2011 . Among Republican nominees , 12 out of 38 to rule have backed the health care law .
“ Liberal and conservative jurists alike are also significantly influenced by the law when making decisions , such as by the text and structure of a statute , ” said Amanda Frost , a law professor at American University . “ Very few judges decide cases entirely as they prefer without paying attention to any of the legal constraints that should govern their decisions , and so ideology does not come close to explaining everything that goes into judicial decision-making . ”
Analysts predict that the subsidies case , known as King v. Burwell , will come down to Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , nominated by Republican presidents nearly two decades apart , who must decide whether Congress wanted Obamacare subsidies restricted to states that fully embraced the law and set up their own insurance exchanges .
“ It seems to me what ’ s happening is King v. Burwell is the last hurrah for these grand challenges to the Affordable Care Act , ” said Timothy Jost , a law professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia , referring to the subsidies case before the court .
Meanwhile , three circuit courts have told religious nonprofits that they see no reason to shield them from the law ’ s contraception mandate , as the issue wends it way through the federal courts a second time .
A Reagan appointee on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit wrote the second of those decisions , noting that Notre Dame University merely had to let the government know that it objected to the mandate .
Religious nonprofits argue that they are treated more stringently than for-profit entities , which must do nothing to opt out of coverage as the Health and Human Services Department rewrites regulations in line with last year ’ s decision .
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C . Circuit ruled against Priests for Life , a pro-life ministry , in November . The 3-0 decision , by two Obama appointees and a Clinton appointee , said the nonprofit only had to fill out a form to opt out of coverage .
Similarly , three Democratic appointees on the 3rd U.S . Circuit turned back a prayer for relief from Geneva College and other plaintiffs in February .
Priests for Life asked the D.C . Circuit to reconsider its decision in a second hearing before the full court , but the nonprofit was turned away last week by the same three Democrat-appointed judges .
Three other judges would have given Priests for Life a second look . Each of them was appointed by a Republican president .
Religious liberty advocates haven ’ t given up , citing occasions in which the Supreme Court told lower courts to revisit their decisions in light of the Hobby Lobby decision .
“ The cases will continue as they have , ” Eric Rassbach , deputy general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty , said after the Notre Dame defeat . “ Every time these issues have reached the Supreme Court , the government has lost and the religious plaintiffs have been granted relief . ”
