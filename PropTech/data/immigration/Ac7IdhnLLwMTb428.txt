While an immigration overhaul has drawn support from church groups , business , labor and even former opponents , there 's still deep opposition — mostly centered in the Republican Party .
The last time a president tried to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul was in 2007 , and George W. Bush 's fellow Republicans in Congress killed his bill . Republican strategist Kevin Madden says a lot has changed since then — including the way the Republican Party is dealing with its own internal divisions .
`` The difference between success and failure this time around will be whether or not those that are very interested in seeing a solution arrived at recognize those objections as substantive and work to either remedy them or address them in some way , '' Madden says . `` What we can not do is demonize those who happen to disagree . ''
In other words : Do n't call the anti-amnesty folks `` wacko birds '' — the way Arizona Sen. John McCain recently referred to his colleague Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul .
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , the GOP 's point person on immigration , understands this very well . That 's why in a record-breaking round of seven Sunday TV appearances last weekend , he had the same message aimed at the same conservative audience , in English and in Spanish .
`` This is not amnesty . Amnesty is the forgiveness of something , '' he said . He also repeated the idea that the current system is `` de facto amnesty . ''
Rubio has also , perhaps more importantly , made the rounds of conservative talk radio , where he has received a warmer welcome than might have been expected .
`` I think the Tom Tancredo days within the party are over , '' says conservative radio host Erick Erickson , who also runs the blog RedState , `` if only because of the shell-shock results of 2012 that the base has had to suffer through . ''
Erickson says this time around many groups that were previously against an immigration overhaul have changed their minds — such as `` some of the local Chambers of Commerce that have been suspicious in the past , some of the Tea Party groups . ''
`` I think we may see them ... come on board for this , '' he says .
Especially since Paul , the de facto leader of the Tea Party in Congress , is also in favor of a comprehensive bill .
Ron Bonjean , a former Republican leadership aide , says he thinks there 's a recognition among `` hard-line conservatives that are anti-amnesty that they do need the Hispanic voters in 2016 , that ... there 's a long-term threat to the existence of the Republican Party . ''
But competing for Hispanic votes is not a top priority for the sizable number of Republican rank and file who still see this bill as amnesty .
`` I really respect the work of the Gang of Eight , '' Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions said on ABC . `` But they have produced legislation , it appears ... that will give amnesty now , legalize everyone that 's here effectively today and then there 's a promise of enforcement in the future . ''
Beyond the Beltway , in the first caucus state of Iowa , conservative talk show host Steve Deace thinks anyone who supports the bill will have a liability in 2016 .
`` There 's not an overwhelming majority of people in a Republican presidential primary in 2016 that are going to go to the polls to vote because of illegal immigration . But those who will all are against anything that looks like any path to citizenship , any amnesty at all , '' he says . `` That 's really where the passion on the issue is . ''
And that 's why this issue is so difficult for the GOP , Bonjean says .
`` For Republicans , this is the Rubik 's Cube , '' he says . `` In order to get this done , they have to walk a fine line from not offending the Republican base — and ... trying not to offend Hispanic voters . ''
But time is not on the side of Republicans who want to work out their internal party politics on immigration carefully and slowly . The legislative clock is ticking . The closer it gets to the 2014 election season , the harder it will be to pass anything .
