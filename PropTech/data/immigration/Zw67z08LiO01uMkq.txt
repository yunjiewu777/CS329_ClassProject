Immigration activists protesting the Trump administration 's decision on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program outside of Trump Tower in New York .
On Tuesday , a San Francisco federal district court judge enjoined—that is , blocked—Trump ’ s attack on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA , program . This injunction is temporary , in place until the court rules on the substance—or the merits—of the challenge to Trump ’ s plan to terminate DACA .
The good news is by granting a preliminary injunction the judge has indicated that he thinks DACA ’ s backers are likely to prevail . The bad news is that the injunction isn ’ t complete .
A federal judge in San Francisco issued a nationwide preliminary injunction Tuesday blocking the Trump administration ’ s decision to phase out a program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation . The injunction by U.S. District Judge William Alsup says those protections must remain in place for the nearly 690,000 immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program while a legal challenge to ending the Obama-era program proceeds . Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the decision to terminate the program on Sept. 5 and said no renewal applications would be accepted after Oct. 5 . Under the administration ’ s plan , permits that expired after March 5 could not be renewed . But Alsup ruled that while the lawsuit is pending , anyone who had DACA status when the program was rescinded Sept. 5 can renew it , officials said .
The White House is in a rage over yet another defeat in court . ( Granted , the threshold is low . )
x New @ PressSec statement on DACA injunction : Ã¢ÂÂWe find this decision to be outrageous , especially in light of the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs successful bipartisan meeting with House and Senate members at the White House on the same day.Ã¢ÂÂ — Monica Alba ( @ albamonica ) January 10 , 2018
Unfortunately , this ruling is far from a sweeping victory for progressives . A few notable humans have flagged the injunction ’ s exceptions , which are significant .
