More people signed up for insurance on HealthCare.gov on Thursday than any time since the launch of the Affordable Care Act exchanges three years ago , President Obama announced Friday .
More than 670,000 people signed up for coverage ahead of the Dec. 15 deadline for Jan. 1 coverage . And that 's despite the fact about 1 million people had to leave their contact information as they could n't get on the site . About 600,000 people signed up last year on Dec. 15 .
The traffic jam prompted the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) to announce late Thursday that the deadline for enrollment on the federal exchange was extended until 11:59 PM PST on Dec. 19 . HealthCare.gov handles enrollment for 38 states . Deadlines for state exchanges vary , but several allow enrollment for Jan. 1 coverage for a few more days .
Signups rose steadily this week . On Monday , more than 325,000 Americans selected plans on HealthCare.gov . On Tuesday , more than 380,000 Americans selected plans on HealthCare.gov , marking two of the biggest days in HealthCare.gov history .
Obama , Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell , Sen. Cory Booker , D-N.J. , and comedian Bill Murray were among those doing videos to encourage enrollment .
The administration has been aggressively promoting the law as Republican members of Congress and President-elect Donald Trump vow to repeal it next month . Even with a repeal , however , people who do n't have insurance through their jobs will still be required to buy it at least through 2017 and likely longer . A plan to replace the ACA could take several years .
Earlier this week , Burwell went on a four-city tour to Tampa , Orlando , New York and East Newark , N.J. , to meet with people who benefited from the ACA and encourage Americans to get covered .
