Viewers who tuned in to watch the 47th Annual Country Music Association Awards , held Wednesday night in Nashville , might have confused the show with a roast of ObamaCare . Country music ’ s hottest stars had a bone to pick with the faulty Healthcare.gov website .
CMA Awards host Brad Paisley jokingly told his co-host Carrie Underwood that his back hurt and he needed to see a doctor . Underwood asked the singer if he had signed up for ObamaCare .
“ Oh , it ’ s great ! ” Underwood quipped . “ I started signing up last Thursday and I ’ m almost done ! ” The “ Blown Away ” singer proceeded to help her co-host sign up for ObamaCare and “ join the six other people ” who have reportedly signed up successfully for the healthcare service .
The routine had the Nashville audience clapping their hands to the tune of newly crowned entertainer of the year George Strait ’ s “ Amarillo by Morning , ” but with the words changed to “ ObamaCare by morning/ Why ’ s this taking so long ? / I ’ m going to end up with hemorrhoids/If I sit here ’ til dawn . ”
The super star hosts also tried to settle the feud between Luke Bryan and Zac Brown who called Bryan ’ s new single “ That ’ s My Kind of Night ” the “ worst song I ’ ve ever heard. ” The two hugged it out while Carrie told them they had nothing to fight about . “ You both made great records and you 're both millionaires , ” she sang to the tune of “ Why Can ’ t We Be Friends . ”
The CMA Award hosts did not stop there . Paisley thanked Swift not acting like her fellow pop star Miley Cyrus . He praised her for “ not once humping a teddy bear or gyrating with beetle juice. ” Underwood joked , “ If someone in music today was going to be caught naked licking a hammer I think we 'd all thought it 'd be Blake Shelton. ” The camera zoomed in on Shelton who nodded his head in agreement .
Next up was a surprise appearance by Willie and Jase Robertson of Duck Dynasty who were joined by their wives Missy and Korie to perform a redneckified version of Robin Thicke ’ s “ Blurred Lines . ”
While the Robertson clan twerked on stage , Underwood and Paisley switched up the words of Thicke ’ s song . “ I 'm going to grow a beard and go out hunting… 'Duck Dynasty ' guys dance to Robin Thicke/We tried to get nasty talking 'Duck Dynasty . ' ”
The Robertson ’ s weren ’ t just onstage to show off their lack of dancing skills ; they also gave out the first award of the night to duo Florida Georgia Line for single of the year for their hit song “ Cruise . ”
The country twosome shot to stardom this year after touring with both Luke Bryan and Taylor Swift on their respective tours . The pair also won vocal duo of the year and opened the show with Luke Bryan singing a medley of Bryan ’ s “ That ’ s My Kind of Night ” and their own “ Cruise. ” The two wins solidified the hip-hop country sound making its way into mainstream country music .
Perhaps the single of the year win will finally put “ Cruise ” to rest . The duo released the song in August of 2012 .
Jason Aldean performed next followed by Kacey Musgraves and Lady Antebellum . Both Aldean and Lady Antebellum surprisingly went home with no awards for the second year in a row .
Musgraves didn ’ t walk away empty handed as she won the title of new artist of the year . However , the “ Follow Your Arrow ” singer displayed a face of disappointment as Miranda Lambert beat her out to win female vocalist of the year for the fourth time in a row .
Lambert ’ s hubby and fellow country singer Blake Shelton scored album of the year and male vocalist of the year .
Vocal group of the year was awarded to Little Big Town and beating out The Band Perry , who were inexplicably ignored yet again . The band of siblings won big at the 2011 CMA Awards but have yet to win any awards since .
Taylor Swift took home the pinnacle award given to those who take country music to a worldwide audience , though her “ Red ” album doesn ’ t have one bit of country twang to it .
Somber moments at the awards included a tribute to the late George Jones as well as an unusually serious Luke Bryan who sang his song “ Drink a Beer ” in memory of his brother and sister .
The highest honor of CMA entertainer of the year was given to veteran country singer Strait who announced his final tour this year . We tip our hats to the “ King of Country . ”
