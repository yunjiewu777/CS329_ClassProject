How much leeway do employers and insurers have in deciding whether they 'll cover contraceptives without charge and in determining which methods make the cut ?
Not much , as it turns out , but that has n't stopped some from trying .
People still write in regularly describing battles they 're waging to get birth control coverage they 're entitled to under the Affordable Care Act .
In one of those messages recently , a woman said her insurer denied free coverage for the NuvaRing . This small plastic device , which is inserted into the vagina monthly , works by releasing hormones like the ones in birth control pills .
She said her insurer told her she would be responsible for her contraceptive expenses unless she chose a generic birth control pill . The NuvaRing costs between $ 15 and $ 80 a month , according to Planned Parenthood .
Under the health law , health plans have to cover the full range of birth control methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration without any cost sharing by women .
There are some exceptions if the plan falls into a limited number of categories that are excluded . One is if the plan is grandfathered under the law . Those plans were around since March 23 , 2010 , or before , and have n't changed much . If your plan is grandfathered , it has to disclose that status to you .
The other exception is if the plan is offered by a religious employer or house of worship . Following the recent Supreme Court decision in the Hobby Lobby case , some private employers that have religious objections to providing birth control coverage as a free preventive benefit will also be excused from the requirement .
In addition , the federal government has given plans some flexibility by allowing them to use `` reasonable medical management techniques '' to keep their costs under control . So if there is both a generic and a brand-name version of a birth control pill available , for example , a plan could decide to cover only the generic version without cost to the patient .
As for the NuvaRing , even though they may use the same hormones , the pill and the ring are different methods of birth control . As an official from the Department of Health and Human Services said in an email , `` The pill , the ring and the patch are different types of hormonal methods . ... It is not permissible to cover only the pill , but not the ring or the patch . ''
Guidance from the federal government clearly states that the full range of FDA-approved methods of birth control must be covered as a preventive benefit without cost sharing . That includes birth control pills , the ring or patch , intrauterine devices and sterilization , among others .
But despite federal guidance , `` we 've seen this happen , plenty , '' says Adam Sonfield , a senior public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute , a reproductive health research and education organization . `` Clearly insurance companies think things are ambiguous enough that they can get away with it . ''
If you are denied coverage , your defense is to appeal the decision and get your state insurance department involved .
`` The state has the right and responsibility to enforce this law , '' says Sonfield .
