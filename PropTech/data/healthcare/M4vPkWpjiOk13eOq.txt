So you think you 've succeeded in making it through the ObamaCare website maze , and now you have health insurance ? You might want to think again .
Despite the Obama administration 's claim that HealthCare.gov is `` vastly improved , '' insurance companies are still grappling with error-riddled files fed to them from the flawed website . The lingering glitch could cause major problems weeks down the road , resulting in people thinking they 've signed up when insurance companies have no record of them doing so .
These so-called `` back-end '' problems were largely glossed over when federal health officials confidently claimed over the weekend they had met their own goals for improving the website by Dec. 1 .
Administration officials said early Sunday that they have fixed roughly 400 computer `` bugs '' and increased capacity so the site can now handle more than 800,000 users daily with an error rate of less than 1 percent . Jeff Zients , the official appointed to fix the ObamaCare site since its disastrous Oct. 1 rollout , said it is `` night and day from what it was . ''
But insurers continue to deal with the same set of problems that have shaken their confidence for weeks in the system they have to rely on to enroll new customers .
`` Until the enrollment process is working from end-to-end , many consumers will not be able to enroll in coverage , '' Karen Ignagni , president of America 's Health Insurance Plans , said in a statement .
She said `` significant 'back-end ' issues ' '' need to be addressed , and particularly the `` ongoing problems '' processing enrollment files known as `` 834 files . ''
These are forms that give insurance companies basic information about would-be customers .
But they 've had problems for weeks . AHIP spokesman Robert Zirkelbach told FoxNews.com that companies are receiving duplicative and inaccurate forms , and `` in some cases , plans are not getting the enrollment files at all . ''
The New York Times reports that companies are getting flooded with phone calls from people who think they 've signed up -- though they 're not on record as having done so .
The ongoing problems mean that people who believe they have a health plan could be in for a surprise on Jan. 1 .
Though the administration has given people until the end of March to sign up for coverage if they want to avoid a fine , coverage for many is supposed to start on Jan. 1 . That leaves just 30 days to fix the remaining glitches .
`` This is not a functioning website yet , '' James Capretta , senior fellow with the Ethics and Public Policy Center , told ███ .
-- Bloomberg reports that after the troubled Oct. 1 launch , the Obama administration boosted its enrollment numbers for November -- with roughly 100,000 people signing up through HealthCare.gov .
That figure , however , is far short of the original goal of enrolling 800,000 people in the first two months .
-- ███ ' own attempt to log in at HealthCare.gov on Sunday was spotty at best .
After the site allowed the user to fill in personal information like a Social Security number , a notice came up that said : `` Verification system temporarily unavailable . ''
In addition , the site asked if a navigator or insurance broker was helping with the application . After `` none of these people '' was selected , a screen came back that said , incorrectly : `` You 've told us another person is helping you complete the application . ''
