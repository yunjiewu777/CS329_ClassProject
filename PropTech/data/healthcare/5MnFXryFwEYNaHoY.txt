Calling it the Affordable Care Act has advantages for Democrats . Taking 'Obama ' out of health care
President Barack Obama and loyal Democrats once embraced the term Obamacare to sell the American people on health care reform .
With the president ’ s approval ratings at record lows , a broken website and Obama under fire for his pledge that people could keep their plans , the “ Affordable Care Act ” has returned .
The president didn ’ t say “ Obamacare ” once during his nearly hourlong news conference last week , while he referred to the “ Affordable Care Act ” a dozen times . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi went so far as to correct David Gregory on “ Meet the Press ” Sunday on the proper terminology . And White House talking points distributed to Democrats and obtained by ███ repeatedly refer to the Affordable Care Act in suggested sound bites , not Obamacare .
Calling it the Affordable Care Act has advantages for Democrats seeking to defend health care reform while still criticizing the bungled White House rollout . The phrase polls better than Obamacare — and people have responded more positively to the law ’ s benefits when they haven ’ t been told they come from Obamacare .
“ You want the law to have approval rating higher than POTUS has , ” a Democratic official said Monday .
“ Obamacare ” started out as a pejorative term during Obama ’ s first campaign , and Republicans , especially the tea party , embraced it during protests and rallies against the health care bill . The media generally steered clear as well — using phrases such as “ health care reform ” to describe the issue .
But Obama last year reappropriated the term for himself , making the phrase a staple of his stump speech and hawking “ I ( heart ) Obamacare ” bumper stickers .
“ We passed Obamacare — yes , I like the term — we passed it because I do care , and I want to put these choices in your hands where they belong , ” Obama said at a typical stop in Iowa last October .
Now , the phrase is vanishing from official use . White House website posts in July ( “ Obamacare in Three Words : Saving People Money ” ) and late September ( “ What Obamacare Means for You ” ) called the health care law the O-word . But now HealthCare.gov is almost entirely scrubbed of “ Obamacare ” and the law is called the Affordable Care Act in nearly every instance . Health insurance exchanges run by states don ’ t use the term Obamacare at all .
A 22-page White House document issued to Democratic Sunday show guests uses the word Obamacare only under a “ general points ” subheading and in a section debunking a purported myth that increased Medicaid enrollment would lead to an older , sicker population signing up for health care through the exchanges .
Instead , the document contains standard White House health care talking points : “ The Affordable Care Act is more than a website ” ; “ We have a great product that people like and tons of interest in the product ” ; and Obama ’ s “ administrative proposal will give consumers more information and choices , including keeping their old plans . ”
The White House talking points suggest that Democrats respond to GOP attacks by pointing to October , when the government was shut down and Congress was staring at a potential default .
“ The GOP has an obsession with the Affordable Care Act , ” the White House talking points read . “ They were willing to shut down the government and threaten our economy and full faith and credit just to try to stop it . That didn ’ t work . ”
