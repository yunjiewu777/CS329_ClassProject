Bill is unlikely to become law , but vulnerable Democrats can say they spoke out against ACA
Pelosi points to states happy with their health care exchanges
WASHINGTON — After 39 Democrats joined Republicans Friday to vote for a bill that would allow insurers to keep health plans that do not meet federal laws , the top House Democrat tried Sunday to show the law has support from most Democrats .
`` I have full confidence , as do my members , however they voted on this , '' House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said on NBC 's Meet the Press . `` This is political . They respond politically . ''
She said the number has n't changed much from two or three months ago when 30 Democrats voted with Republicans on other House bills not supported by the president or Pelosi . Friday 's bill is unlikely to move toward a Senate vote , but House Democrats would be able to use it to say they had spoken out against a law that could be unpopular in their districts .
Pelosi said there is no way to tell what will happen next year as Democrats go up for re-election after the shaky start to the federal health exchange website , HealthCare.gov . However , she said , `` I will tell you this : Democrats stand tall in support of the Affordable Care Act . ''
Rather than dwell on the problems with the law — the broken website , the president 's promise to allow insurers to offer customers their old plans — Pelosi tried to move toward the future .
Some states with their own exchanges , such as California and Kentucky , are signing up customers and raving about the prices . California announced Friday it would soon include online enrollment for the Small Business Health Options Program for businesses with fewer than 50 employees . By Nov. 12 , about 60,000 people had chosen insurance plans through the state 's exchange .
