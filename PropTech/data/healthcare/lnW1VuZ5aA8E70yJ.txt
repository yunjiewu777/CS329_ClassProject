Despite being one of the bluest states in the country and one of the first to implement state based Obamacare exchanges , doctors in California are boycotting Obamacare ... a whopping 70 percent of them .
An estimated seven out of every 10 physicians in deep-blue California are rebelling against the state 's Obamacare health insurance exchange and wo n't participate , the head of the state 's largest medical association said .
“ It does n't surprise me that there 's a high rate of nonparticipation , ” said Dr. Richard Thorp , president of the California Medical Association .
Thorp has been a primary care doctor for 38 years in a small town 90 miles north of Sacramento . The CMA represents 38,000 of the roughly 104,000 doctors in California .
So why exactly the push back ? Under Obamcare , doctors are practically expected to work for free .
“ We need some recognition that we ’ re doing a service to the community . But we can ’ t do it for free . And we can ’ t do it at a loss . No other business would do that , ” he said .
California offers one of the lowest government reimbursement rates in the country -- 30 percent lower than federal Medicare payments . And reimbursement rates for some procedures are even lower .
Once again the argument that Republicans are blocking Obamacare 's implementation and fear mongering about the law is completely blown out of the water . This is n't the first time we 've seen major concerns or push back against Obamcare in the Golden State . Earlier this year , top California Democrat and Insurance Commission Dave Jones warned about fraud and identity theft risks posed to consumers on the exchanges .
The state insurance commissioner and anti-fraud groups say the exchange is falling short in ensuring that the people hired as counselors are adequately screened and monitored .
Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones also said the exchange does not have a plan for investigating any complaints that might arise once the counselors start work . That means consumers who might fall prey to bogus health care products , identity theft and other abuses will have a hard time seeking justice if unscrupulous counselors get ahold of their Social Security number , bank accounts , health records or other private information , he said .
`` We can have a real disaster on our hands , '' Jones , a Democrat , said in an interview .
Doctors boycotting Obamacare is the least of our worries , the biggest problem is doctors choosing the leave medicine completely as a result of the healthcare law . According to a recent survey , more than 60 percent of doctors plan to leave medicine early as Obamacare changes the way America does medicine .
Most physicians have a pessimistic outlook on the future of medicine , citing eroding autonomy and falling income , a survey of more than 600 doctors found .
Six in 10 physicians ( 62 % ) said it is likely many of their colleagues will retire earlier than planned in the next 1 to 3 years , a survey from Deloitte Center for Health Solutions found . That perception is uniform across age , gender , and specialty , it said .
Another 55 % of surveyed doctors believe others will scale back hours because of the way medicine is changing , but the survey did n't elaborate greatly on how it was changing . Three-quarters think the best and brightest may not consider a career in medicine , although that is an increase from the 2011 survey result of 69 % .
`` Physicians recognize 'the new normal ' will necessitate major changes in the profession that require them to practice in different settings as part of a larger organization that uses technologies and team-based models for consumer ( patient ) care , '' the survey 's findings stated .
If you think liberals are concerned about a doctor shortage , think again . Just a few weeks back liberal Salon writer Matt Yglesias told `` whiny '' doctors to shut up about lesser pay under Obamacare and Democrats on Capitol Hill have offered no serious solutions to solving a doctor crisis and or the lack of reimbursement costs .
