Lindsey Graham holds forth on why Republicans just got ta take your health coverage .
Republican healthcare repeal bills have been massively unpopular . Many of the members of Congress who ’ ve supported them have hidden out and refused to face constituents , while those who dared hold town halls were angrily confronted . Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski was hailed as a hero back home for her vote against repeal . But the Washington Post lets us know what really mattered to the Republican senators who are now , yet again , getting ready to vote for a massively unpopular bill . After they failed at their longtime campaign promise of Obamacare repeal :
... according to GOP senators and aides , Republicans faced an unrelenting barrage of confrontations with some of their closest supporters , donors and friends . The moments occurred in small gatherings that proved even more meaningful than a caustic town hall — at meetings with local business executives , at church , at parks .
They didn ’ t dare hold town halls open to all their constituents , but boy , they heard it from their donors . The GOP ’ s repeal bills might have had support under 15 percent in some polls , might have had less than half the support of Obamacare … but the hardcore base , the Republican donors and local bigwigs who your senator actually listens to and cares about ? They were all worked up by Donald Trump ’ s tweets and angry that congressional Republicans had failed . And that ’ s why Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying , again , to ram through a vote on a bill that few people understand but that has an awful lot in common with those earlier bills that voters loathed .
Thought Obamacare was safe ? Think again . Republicans have revived their repeal effort and we must stop them . Keep calling your senators at ( 202 ) 224-3121 and tell them DON ’ T REPEAL OBAMACARE ! ( After you call , please tell us how it went . )
