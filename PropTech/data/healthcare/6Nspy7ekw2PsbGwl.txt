Even President Obama has now given up on trying to make Americans like his health care policy . In an interview with The New York Times , President Obama said that he can ’ t turn around public opinion on Obamacare through a PR push , but instead people will begin to appreciate the law once it goes into affect .
Even though polls show that the majority of people do not like the Obamacare law , the president still seems to believe that once they are forced to purchase health insurance , or pay a penalty , everyone will start to love it . But it seems like that is not really going to be the case .
Once again , the President likes to blame everyone else for the lack of success he has seen when it comes to Obamacare .
`` But until then , when we ’ re getting outspent four to one and people are just uncertain about what all this means for them , we ’ re going to continue to have some polls like that , '' Obama said . `` And me just making more speeches explaining it in and of itself won ’ t do it . The test of this is going to be is it working . And if it works , it will be pretty darn popular . ”
Even with a new PR blitz , the President can ’ t win over the public opinion :
`` Over the course of six months to a year , as people sign up , and it works , and lo and behold , the people who already have health insurance are not being impacted at all other than the fact that their insurance is more secure and they are getting free preventive care , and all the nightmare scenarios and the train wrecks and the 'sky is falling ' predictions that come from the other side do not happen , then health care will become more popular , '' Obama said .
It ’ s funny how the President seems to think that Americans are not aware of what Obamacare really has in store for us . But we are quite aware ! The penalty will not be worth it Mr. President !
