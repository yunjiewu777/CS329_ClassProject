Award-winning actress and emerging Washington power player Eva Longoria told us on `` This Week '' that immigration reform should be a top priority in President Obama 's second term .
`` People say , 'Oh , get in the back of the line , ' [ but ] people do n't realize there 's a hundred lines to get into , '' said Longoria of the immigration process . `` It 's a very broken system ''
Just this week , the Wall Street Journal labeled the former `` Desperate Housewives '' star a `` Hispanic activist and power player in Washington , D.C. '' She 's been a top supporter of President Obama , serving as a co-chair of his reelection campaign and taking center stage last September for a speech at the Democratic National Convention .
Now , she is an executive producer and host of the Latino Inaugural , a concert at the Kennedy Center featuring performances by several artists including Jose Feliciano , Melanie Griffith and New York City 's Ballet Hispanico . Longoria is also a co-chair of the Presidential Inauguration Committee , which is in full swing this week as Obama prepares to be sworn in for his second term .

`` What I am hopeful about is that this administration , and particularly President Obama , sees that immigration is an economic issue , '' Longoria said . `` We have to understand that we are dependent upon a labor in this country , specifically agriculture , to provide low-cost products , and they 're jobs that nobody else is doing . ''
Despite the partisanship in Washington , she said there 's room for compromise on both sides of the aisle on immigration .
`` There was a historic mobilization this election with the Latino vote , '' said Longoria , who was one of President Obama 's leading Latino fundraisers , or `` bundlers , '' for his reelection campaign .
`` I think the Republicans are going to realize , if they do n't do it because it 's morally imperative , they have to do it because it 's politically imperative , '' she said . `` And if they 're not going to do it because it 's politically imperative , they 've got to do it because it 's economically imperative . So there 's a lot of gains for everybody , no matter what party affiliation , to get this done and to fix this problem . ''
While she plans to remain politically active , Longoria told me she 'll pass on running for office in her home state of Texas .
`` I respect everything that politicians do . I think it 's a very , very big job , '' she said . `` It 's not my day job , so I 'm just doing what I can to help the communities in which I came from . ''
