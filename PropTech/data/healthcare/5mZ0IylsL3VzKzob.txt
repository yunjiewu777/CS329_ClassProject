This would n't be Azar 's first stint with the Department , previously serving as general counsel and later as deputy secretary of HHS under President George W. Bush 's administration .
Following his time at HHS , he rose to role of President of Eli Lilly USA , a global pharmaceutical company .
He comes on board after Mr. Trump selected Eric Hargan to serve as acting HHS secretary last month , filling the vacant spot left by former secretary Tom Price who resigned amid of flurry of probes into his government travel .
In a statement from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders , Price `` offered his resignation '' and `` the president accepted '' late September .
Mr. Trump had indicated he might fire Price , and said he was `` not happy '' with the `` optics '' of the situation . Mr. Trump at the time called Price a `` very fine person . ''
Politico first reported that Price had billed the government for at least $ 400,000 in private charter planes . A second report found that Price also used at least $ 500,000 worth of military jet travel abroad for him and his wife , Betty .
In his letter to the president , Price cited the recent controversies surrounding his expensive travel , saying `` I have spent forty years both as a doctor and public servant putting people first . I regret that the recent events have created a distraction from these important objectives . ''
Price 's tenure in the Trump administration lasted less than eight months .
