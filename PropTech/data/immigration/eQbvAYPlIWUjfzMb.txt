President Obama ’ s temporary deportation amnesty will make it easier for illegal immigrants to improperly register and vote in elections , state elections officials testified to Congress on Thursday , saying that the driver ’ s licenses and Social Security numbers they will be granted create a major voting loophole .
While stressing that it remains illegal for noncitizens to vote , secretaries of state from Ohio and Kansas said they won ’ t have the tools to sniff out illegal immigrants who register anyway , ignoring stiff penalties to fill out the registration forms that are easily available at shopping malls , motor vehicle bureaus and in curbside registration drives .
Anyone registering to vote attests that he or she is a citizen , but Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted said mass registration drives often aren ’ t able to give due attention to that part , and so illegal immigrants will still get through .
Kansas Secretary of State Kris W. Kobach said even some motor vehicle bureau workers automatically ask customers if they want to register to vote , which some noncitizens in the past have cited as their reason for breaking the law to register .
Democrats disputed that it was an issue at all , saying Mr. Obama ’ s new policy , which could apply to more than 4 million illegal immigrants , doesn ’ t change anything in state or federal law .
Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton , the District of Columbia ’ s nonvoting member of Congress , accused Republicans of an effort at voter suppression .
“ The president ’ s executive order gives immigrants the right to stay — immigrants who have been here for years , immigrants who have been working hard and whose labor we have needed , ” Ms. Norton said . “ The Republicans may want to go down in history as the party who tried once again 100 years later to nullify the right to vote . Well , I am here to say they shall not succeed . ”
Rep. Stephen F. Lynch , Massachusetts Democrat , said he doubted illegal immigrants would risk running afoul of the law — which could get them deported — just to be an insignificant part of an election .
The hearing was the latest GOP effort to dent Mr. Obama ’ s executive action , announced in November , which grants tentative legal status and work permits to as many as 4 million illegal immigrant parents whose children are either U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents . The president also expanded a 2012 policy for so-called Dreamers , or illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children , granting them tentative legal status and work permits as well .
Republicans say there are a host of unintended consequences , including the chances of illegal voting , a perverse incentive created by Obamacare that would make newly legalized workers more attractive to some businesses than American workers and complications with the tax code .
The newly legalized workers can apply for back refunds from the IRS even for years when they didn ’ t file their taxes , agency Commissioner John Koskinen told Congress on Wednesday .
Mr. Koskinen said the White House never spoke with him about potential consequences before Mr. Obama announced his policy changes . The secretaries of state who testified to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Thursday said they too never heard from Mr. Obama ahead of time .
Mr. Husted has written the Obama administration asking for help in identifying the name and date of birth of all noncitizens who get Social Security numbers , which he said would allow states to go back and clear illegally registered voters from their rolls .
“ Why I wrote the letter is I want to comply with federal law , ” he said .
Matthew Dunlap , Maine ’ s secretary of state , said he believed the laws already on the books are good enough to stop any voting mischief in his state , and he doubted illegal immigrants had incentive or intent to try to interfere with U.S. elections .
“ My experience is they don ’ t come here to vote , and they don ’ t come here to drive . They come here for a better life , ” he said .
Mr. Kobach countered with a story about a legal permanent resident who had not yet become a citizen but who registered and voted nonetheless , and who said she wanted to support candidates who would help her earn citizenship faster .
Only four states require proof of citizenship before someone registers to vote , Mr. Kobach said . And even in those states , the federal government offers voter registration cards that don ’ t require proof of citizenship , giving determined illegal immigrants a way to circumvent checks .
