As the administration touts the benefits of ObamaCare in a push to sign up more people before the March deadline , a FoxNews.com review shows how much of the law has really been pushed off .
Since its inception , provisions of the law have been delayed a total of 28 times ; the average delay was six months and three weeks . Put another way , the cumulative delays add up to an astonishing 15 years and three months .
The administration has been announcing changes to the law at a fairly steady clip .
The White House 's latest delay was rolled out on Feb. 10 , and allowed companies with between 50 and 99 workers to skirt the mandate to provide health care until 2016 .
Of the White House 's 28 delays to the law , 13 have been set to last at least one year . Eight revisions last a month or more . The shortest delay , announced in December 2013 , gave Americans one extra day to purchase coverage that would begin on Jan. 1 , 2014 through HealthCare.gov . Ultimately , that delay was extended to a vague `` more time . ''
In some cases , groups most loyal to President Obama have fared poorly under the law 's recent delays .
While 71 percent of Latinos voted in 2012 for Obama , Spanish-speakers needed to wait over two months for their version of HealthCare.gov , Cuidadodesalud.gov . In September 2013 , the White House said Spanish-speakers would need to wait just three to four more weeks . The White House is still facing complaints that the site was not translated correctly .
Americans who work at companies employing 50-99 workers in the 36 states that use HealthCare.gov expected their employers to be required to offer them health insurance on Jan. 1 , 2014 .
After a pair of one-year delays , they will be guaranteed work-provided insurance -- but only in 2016 . The owners of those small businesses are n't faring well under the delays either -- the launch date for their federal exchange site , Small Business Health Options Program ( SHOP ) , was pushed back to November 2015 in late 2013 .
Only one of the 28 delays does n't have an end-date announced by the White House . On Dec. 24 , 2013 , more time was offered to those who wanted to sign up for coverage that would start in 2014 but could not because of HealthCare.gov 's glitches . The deadline to choose January coverage was originally Dec. 23 , but the last day to sign up for coverage retroactive to January has not been declared -- other than March 31 , the scheduled final day to choose a plan for this coverage year .
Thirteen Senate Democrats , or over a quarter of the caucus , have openly distanced themselves from the law 's rollout . Those Democrats have largely been in favor of further delays or extensions , staving off the law 's regulations . Since the October rollout , no Democrat has introduced legislation to bar the White House 's delays , which would in turn speed along the rollout .
All changes to the law directed by the White House have slackened the Affordable Care Act 's original intent and regulation start-dates .
If no additional delays are pushed beyond 2016 , Obama is set to see the law fully implemented for no more than one quarter of his time in office .
