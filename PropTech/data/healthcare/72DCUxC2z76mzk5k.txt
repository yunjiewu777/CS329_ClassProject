Conservative critics of President Obama ’ s health care reforms are engaged in two long-shot lawsuits to overturn the Affordable Care Act or disable one of its central provisions . Both lawsuits should be recognized for what they really are — attempts to use the courts to scuttle a law that Congressional Republicans have repeatedly tried , but failed , to repeal through the political process .
One case , now before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , makes the specious argument that the entire law should be overturned because the bill did not “ originate ” in the House . The suit was brought by a conservative legal foundation on behalf of an Iowa artist who does not want to buy health insurance or pay a fine , as the law requires . The lawyers build their entire case on the legislative procedure used when the reform law was passed .
The act started out as a House bill to modify tax credits for certain first-time home buyers and increase the estimated tax payments owed by corporations . That bill passed the House by a vote of 416 to 0 in late 2009 . When it got to the Senate , the text and title of the bill were struck and replaced with the text and title of the Affordable Care Act . That version of the bill passed the Senate in late 2009 and then the House in March 2010 , when it was signed into law by President Obama .
The plaintiff ’ s lawyers argue that this process violated the “ origination clause ” in Article 1 of the Constitution , which says “ All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills. ” They contend the Senate did not merely “ amend ” the original House bill because the health care reform amendment was not germane to the original bill .
