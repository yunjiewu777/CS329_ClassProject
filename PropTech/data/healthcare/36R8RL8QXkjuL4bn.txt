Last week Americans For Tax Reform released new information showing that during Hawaii 's special Obamacare enrollment period , zero people enrolled . The total state cost for the exchange sits at more than $ 200 million .
While Hawaii enrolled zero individuals and is the worst performing state , it is not alone . Vermont signed up only 97 households , while Rhode Island enrolled just 25 households .
Hawaii ’ s dismal performance should not be surprising . The website cost taxpayers $ 205 million but could only enroll 8,592 individuals in year one . Cost to taxpayers per enroll : $ 23,899 .
The state legislature recently rejected a $ 28 million bailout for the website meaning that a contingency plan to dismantle the exchange and migrate to the federal exchange will be implemented immediately . Unfortunately , taxpayers are not off the hook yet as it is expected that moving to the federally run healthcare.gov will cost $ 30 million .
Now , due to a lack of enrollment and a failed website , Hawaii has scrapped the state based exchange altogether and will be moving to the federal Obamacare system .
Hawaii is taking its troubled ObamaCare insurance exchange off life support , the governor ’ s office announced Friday , the latest addition to a growing number of state exchanges forced to close after operations became unsustainable .
The once-highly praised Hawaii Health Connector has been “ unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain operations , ” Gov . David Ige ’ s office said in a statement . The federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services ( CMS ) informed the exchange last week that federal funds were no longer available to support long-term operations .
“ The state is working with the Connector and CMS to determine what functions can be transitioned to state oversight to ensure compliance with the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) by the next Open Enrollment in November 2015 , ” Ige said .
I wonder if the Obama administration will accuse blue Hawaii of playing politics or attempting to sabotage President Obama 's signature health care law by scrapping the state based exchange . After all , that 's what the White House said about Republican governors to refused to implement state exchanges in the first place .
Hawaii 's decision to scrap the exchange comes just ahead of the Supreme Court decision in King v. Burwell , the case surrounding whether federal subsides taken by people in states without state based exchanges are legal .
