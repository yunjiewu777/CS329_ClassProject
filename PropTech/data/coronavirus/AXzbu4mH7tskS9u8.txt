Scientists around the world are scrambling to find a vaccine — the ultimate Covid-19 panacea . There are now 70 candidate vaccines in development , up from to 44 on March 20 , according to a document from WHO published Saturday . Experts expect it to take between 12 and 18 months to get a vaccine approved for mass use . Of the 70 Covid-19 vaccines in development , only three are currently in clinical trials , meaning they are being tested on humans . Clinical trials are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a new drug and consist of several phases , each involving more patients . China 's CanSino Biological , in partnership with the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology , is in the lead , with the only candidate vaccine currently in phase two trials . U.S. players Moderna and Inovio Pharmaceuticals are the other two developers testing vaccines on humans and both are currently in phase one . The remaining 67 potential vaccines are still only in the pre-clinical trial stage .
To bridge the gap between now and then — when a vaccine is approved — scientists continue to search for effective treatments , with efforts focused on several existing drugs . British health-care giant AstraZeneca has joined this effort , announcing today that it would start a clinical trial to assess the potential of Calquence , a drug already approved for the treatment of leukaemia , in the treatment of the immune response associated with Covid-19 . The trial is expected to open for enrolment in the coming days in the U.S. and several countries in Europe .
