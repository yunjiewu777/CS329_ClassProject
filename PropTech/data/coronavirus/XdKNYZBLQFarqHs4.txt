“ You don ’ t see that , especially in a landlord-tenant relationship in New York City , ” Mr. Gentile , 28 , said . “ He ’ s amazing . ”
As New York City started to shut down in mid-March , Mr. Gentile quickly lost his job . He was a lawyer for a personal injury firm who spent most of his time in courthouses , all of which were closed on March 18 . There was little work for him outside the courtroom .
The law firm ’ s partners told him that they hope to rehire him when the economy rebounds , he said . But without a job and rent almost due , Mr. Gentile spent the end of March stressing about using his savings for bills , including what he and his fiancée had reserved for their wedding in November .
“ It has alleviated a huge amount of stress that I have been having with the unemployment system in the state , ” he said , adding that he had called the New York State Department of Labor roughly 240 times over two days in March to finally connect with a person to file for benefits .
For decades , Mr. Salerno has been a larger-than-life character in his part of Williamsburg , on the other side of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway from the ritzy high-rises near the East River . During the day , he runs the Salerno Auto Body Shop and gasoline station , which his father opened in 1959 .
In the 1980s , Mr. Salerno started to buy vacant lots across Brooklyn to store cars damaged in accidents before they were repaired . In the late 1990s , he started to turn 18 of the lots into apartment buildings .
The repair shop and station are both open , though gasoline sales are down about half from a month ago , he said . He would prefer not to be working on people ’ s cars during the pandemic , but wanted to be there for his customers .
“ Do I really want to do a simple oil change and a brake job ? ” Mr. Salerno said on the phone at the auto shop on Thursday . “ No , but I have a lot of doctors and nurses who need their cars serviced . ”
