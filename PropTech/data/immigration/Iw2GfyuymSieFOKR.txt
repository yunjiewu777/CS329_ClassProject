The report is based on results from four national surveys , one in Ohio and focus groups in Arizona , Florida and Ohio . It compares results from a national poll in March with a similar bilingual telephone survey that was conducted nationwide in English and Spanish from Nov. 6 to 10 among 1,005 adults , with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points . The nonprofit research institute conducts surveys on public policy issues and religious values .
Support for citizenship has not changed significantly since March , the institute found .
The group drilled down into that issue , creating subgroups for the November survey who were asked questions with differing levels of detail about the requirements immigrants should have to meet to become citizens . When there was no mention of requirements , 59 percent supported an option for citizenship . When the question specified that immigrants would have to pay back taxes , learn English and pass background checks , support increased to 71 percent .
The requirements were “ most important for Republicans , ” the report said . When the question did not mention requirements , only about four in 10 Republicans supported citizenship . When the requirements were described in more detail , Republican support increased to 62 percent .
In June , the Senate passed a broad bipartisan bill with a 13-year pathway to citizenship that includes the hurdles mentioned in the poll : paying back taxes and passing English tests and criminal background checks . House leaders have said they will not take up that measure , but will address immigration issues in smaller bills . Several House Republican leaders have said they are drafting measures that would provide “ lawful status ” for many unauthorized immigrants but no “ special path ” to citizenship .
According to the report , nearly seven in 10 Americans believe the 13-year wait for citizenship under the Senate bill is too long , while 24 percent said it was just right .
