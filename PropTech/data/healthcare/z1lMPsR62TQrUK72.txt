Sunday on ABC ’ s “ This Week , ” while discussing the Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare , Sen. Tom Cotton ( R-AR ) said he was “ afraid if they vote for the bill , they ’ ll put the House majority at risk next year . ”
Cotton said , “ As it ’ s written today , this bill can not pass the Senate . I believe it would have adverse consequences for millions of Americans and wouldn ’ t deliver on our promises to reduce the cost of health insurance to Americans . I would say to my friends in the house of representatives , with whom I serve , do not walk the plank and vote for a bill that can not pass the Senate and then have to face the consequences of that vote . George , you were in the White House in 1993 . You remember when House Democrats voted for a BTU energy tax . Not only did that not become law , it didn ’ t get a vote in the Senate . And those Democrats lost their next election because they voted on that tax . They call it getting BTU ’ d . I don ’ t think this bill can pass the Senate . And therefore , I think the house should take a pause and try to get as close as we can to a good result before they send to it the Senate . ”
He added , “ I ’ m afraid if they vote for the bill , they ’ ll put the House majority at risk next year . And we have majorities in the house and the senate and the White House . Not only to repeal Obamacare and get health care reform right , to reform our taxes and our regulations and to build up our military and to accomplish many other things . I don ’ t want to see the house put at risk on a bill that won ’ t pass the Senate . That ’ s why I think we should take a pause , try to solve as many of the problems on Medicaid and the individual insurance market in the bill in the house , and then allow the Senate to take its work up . ”
