• Gran and Gramps Clinton hurry back to the trail
• Kansas tea party leaders to meet on Roberts ’ race
It ’ s been a year since the Obama administration presided over the crash landing of ObamaCare , so what have we learned ? First , the human beings remain almost uniformly bad at predicting the future at any distance . Attitudes about the law are basically identical to this point in 2013 . There has been no “ death spiral ” but neither has there been much change of heart about a law Americans do not like . And while smart-set reporters say that the issue is passé , the truth is that while Americans have become inured to the law ( much as they have to their dreary economic circumstances ) it ( like the economy ) remains part of the background music for the electoral drama currently playing out . But what ’ s in the foreground is part of that too .
[ In this latest study by the Brookings Institute , only 36 percent of Democratic candidates have expressed support for Obamacare ]
Frying pan or fire ? - Part of the reason that ObamaCare is getting less attention these days , other than voter and media fatigue , is competition for attention . It is good for Democrats that the current round of ObamaCare insurance disruptions aren ’ t getting the attention they were amid the “ If you like it you can keep it ” debacle . But look at what stories are replacing those about ObamaCare victims : The president blaming his intelligence team for failing to intervene soon enough against ISIS . Russia is bristling with aggression . Ebola has come to Texas . The Secret Service is in utter disarray . Immigration activists are furious over executive inaction after a border crisis froze the president ’ s pen . Just imagine if someone a year ago had described the current situation . It makes ObamaCare ’ s disastrous rollout sound like a walk in the park .
[ GAO says bailouts need approval - Washington Examiner : “ The Department of Health and Human Services can not legally bail out the insurance industry for excessive losses through President Obama ’ s health care law unless the U.S. Congress approves language allowing the administration to do so , according to a legal opinion released on Tuesday by the Government Accountability Office . ” ]
ISIS alone - A year ago , we hadn ’ t heard about ISIS much and the president was still touting his handiwork against al Qaeda . That Obama would be forced to resume the war in Iraq and then later admit fault ( or at least place it on a subordinate ) would have been unimaginable to most . And the other big stories of this October sound more like movie plots than news stories . Pandemics , security breaches , migrant surges at the southern border , Russian territorial advances : Sounds more like Tom Clancy than the rundown for the evening news . So while Democrats are cheering that the Titanic of health care isn ’ t still scraping the iceberg , they may want to check the arrival schedule for the Hindenburg .

After the briefest pause for grandparenthood , the Clintons are hitting the road in force . The Democrats ’ 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton , who cancelled two events in the Washington area Tuesday , sent former president Bill as campaigner-in-chief to a fundraiser for Maryland Democratic gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown that reportedly netted $ 1.2 million . Hillary was the main draw at a high-dollar Democratic congressional fundraiser in Manhattan on Monday and is slated to stump in Miami Thursday for Florida gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist . The former secretary of State will return to the Big Apple “ this week ” according to the AP , to fundraise for New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen . While Hillary hasn ’ t been in the critical primary state since her 2008 presidential bid , her husband plans to stump for the Dems in New Hampshire on October 16 .
Bubba stumps - Before Bubba gets back to New Hampshire , the former Arkansas governor is headed back home where vulnerable Sen. Mark Pryor , D-Ark. , is struggling , to boost former Clinton driver and Rep. Mike Ross ’ s , D-Ark . bid for the governor ’ s mansion and the congressional campaign of former Clinton FEMA Director James Lee Witt . Also hoping for more help in red states carried by Clinton in the 1990s are Kentucky Senate hopeful Alison Lundergan Grimes , daughter of FOB Jerry Lundergan , and Georgia Senate candidate Michelle Nunn .
And how about the current president ? - The Clintons ’ aggressive campaigning is in stark contrast to the anemic schedule of President Obama . The president is heading to his home state today ahead of a Thursday speech on the economy , in which the president will no doubt try to defend his claim that Americans are better off than they were six years ago . Obama will also headline a big-buck fundraiser for Democratic Gov . Pat Quinn ’ s agonizing re-election bid . But guess who elese is coming to dinner ? Illinois native Hillary will reportedly be in the state to stump for Quinn on Oct 8 .

[ Buuuut… - Tim Carney argues that the GOP can ’ t connect to populist voters with Romney “ Republicans are never going to get back the White Bread vote . They should instead go for the blue-collar vote . That means new priorities . And a new candidate . ” ]
