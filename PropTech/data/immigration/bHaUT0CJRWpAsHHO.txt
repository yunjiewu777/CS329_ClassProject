Trying to jump-start his second-term agenda , President Obama called on House lawmakers Thursday to approve comprehensive immigration reform , saying that current system “ isn ’ t fair . ”
“ We have kicked this particular can down the road for too long , ” Mr. Obama said with supporters of immigration reform in the East Room of the White House . “ This is the moment when we should be able to finally get the job done . Let ’ s go get it done . ”
House Republican leaders said Wednesday they still intend to hold an immigration debate this year , but they won ’ t take up the kind of comprehensive reform plan approved by the Senate . After a 16-day government shutdown , the legislative calendar is short for Mr. Obama to get his priorities acted on this year .
The president said the Senate bill , which grants a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants , would be good for the economy and for the country . He said Republican leaders should disregard the politics of the issue .
“ I ’ m not running for office again ; I just believe this is the right thing to do , ” Mr. Obama said . “ What we can ’ t do is just sweep the problem under the rug one more time . Let ’ s not delay , and let ’ s do it in a bipartisan fashion . ”
“ It ’ s not smart . It ’ s not fair . It doesn ’ t make sense , ” Mr. Obama said .
Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , said through a spokesman that the president isn ’ t going to get his wish .
“ The speaker agrees that America has a broken immigration system and we need reform that would boost our economy , ” said spokesman Brendan Buck . “ He ’ s also been clear that the House will not consider any massive , Obamacare-style legislation that no one understands . Instead , the House is committed to a common sense , step-by-step approach that gives Americans confidence that reform is done the right way . We hope that the president will work with us — not against us — as we pursue this deliberate approach . ”
