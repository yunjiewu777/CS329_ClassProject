The number of people who have died of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States has now surpassed the number of people killed in the September 11 , 2001 terror attacks .
The virus ’ s death toll in the US hit more than 3,100 on March 30 , exceeding the 2,977 victims who were killed in the World Trade Center , the Pentagon , and four hijacked planes on September 11 . While the virus is incomparable in many ways to the sudden deaths on American soil in a terrorist attack , its slow-moving toll on civilian lives promises to upend American society in peacetime as only terror has done . And while the death toll surpassed 3,000 today , the number of confirmed cases is still rising rapidly , meaning many more people will likely die from COVID-19 in the weeks and months ahead .
The impact of September 11 went far beyond its initial death toll : Thousands of people were injured in the attacks , and thousands more died of diseases caused by exposure to toxic substances in the aftermath of the rubble of the Twin Towers . Its economic impact was similarly grim : In the three months following the attack , New York City ’ s economy lost 143,000 jobs each month and $ 2.8 billion in wages , according to a New York Times report from 2004 .
The coronavirus ’ s effects will be far-reaching , as well . An estimated 160,000 people have been infected with the coronavirus in the United States , resulting in more than 20,000 hospitalizations and placing an unprecedented strain on the nation ’ s health care system . In addition , more than 3 million people have filed for unemployment due to the shuttering of non-essential businesses across the country . As the economy stumbled , the Congress passed a $ 2.2 trillion stimulus package—the largest of its kind in modern history .
