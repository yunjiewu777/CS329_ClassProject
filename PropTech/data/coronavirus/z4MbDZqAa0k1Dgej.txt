( ███ ) - The United States is preparing to issue guidance on reducing “ unnecessary ” testing for COVID-19 as it works to cut turnaround times for tests , a senior U.S. health official said on Thursday .
Details of the guidance are still being hammered out but it would be aimed partly at discouraging COVID-19 patients who have completed home quarantine from getting retested before returning to work or school , said Brett Giroir , assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .
Speaking on a call with reporters , he said such unnecessary tests were “ clogging up the system . ”
“ You do not need to be retested unless you are a critically ill person in the hospital or a very unusual case with immune suppression in which case you could shed virus for longer than seven or eight days , ” he said .
“ Turnaround times continue to be an issue ” for COVID-19 tests , he added , saying he would like to see the average get down to three days . Currently , only 26 states are taking three days or less to produce test results , with one state taking more than five days .
The new guidance on testing is “ not a result of shortages , ” Girior added , but rather because such tests are not needed .
The U.S. government is trying to facilitate a transition away from lab-based tests , which can have longer turnaround times , to point-of-care tests , which can provide results in minutes and be conducted in a wider variety of locations .
The U.S. government expects there will be 20 million point-of-care tests per month available by September , Girior said .
Becton Dickinson on Wednesday said the U.S. government agreed to buy 750,000 of its point-of-care tests .
