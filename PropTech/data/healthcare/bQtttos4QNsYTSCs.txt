ObamaCare appears at least for now to be off life support -- after a total 2.1 million Americans enrolled to get insurance coverage this year . But whether President Obama ’ s signature health care law survives -- at least in its entirety -- remains uncertain .
Despite House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other ardent supporters of ObamaCare declaring that it remains “ the law of the land , ” other congressional Democrats facing re-election this year have hinted at cannibalizing the legislation in the face of a confused and frustrated electorate .
In early November , 39 House Democrats , including many in battleground districts , voted to allow millions of Americans to keep the health care plans they lost under ObamaCare , joining Republicans who have rigorously opposed the 2010 law since then-presidential candidate Obama proposed it in 2007 .
Weeks after the recent House vote , Sen. Mary Landrieu , D-La. , among the most vulnerable Senate Democrats and who had roughly 90,000 people in her home state get their insurance revoked , also broke with her party by introducing a similar bill .
Yet the broader issue looming beyond the politics is whether the entire , federally subsidized program can become self-sustainable by getting enough enrollees , preferably younger Americans , or fall into what critics are calling the “ death spiral . ”
Their argument is that the administration will need millions of younger , healthy Americans to sign up to cover the costs of older enrollees who typically need more medical care . And without the young and healthy , insurance companies will increase prices to cover their losses , which will result in fewer enrollees and some sort of government intervention , the critics further argue .
“ If they do [ succeed , ] it 'll be pure , irrational dumb luck , ” said Dan Holler of Heritage Action for America , which has helped lead efforts to “ defund ” ObamaCare . “ The program they designed , and the incentives they put in place , look destined to fail . ”
Holler argued Tuesday that ObamaCare problems are systemic , with doctors eventually no longer accepting low reimbursements and Americans “ refusing to spend exorbitant amounts of money on plans that wo n't allow them to keep their doctor . ”
However , the results of Kaiser Family Foundation study released last week suggest only a slight increase in insurance premiums in 2015 , despite low enrollment so far by young people . ( Rates are already locked in for 2014 . )
`` It is nowhere near what is sometimes referred to as a death spiral , '' Larry Levitt , a health economist at the foundation , said following the report 's release , according to Reuters .
Preliminary figures suggest roughly 25 percent of Americans who have so far signing up for ObamaCare are in the crucial 18-to-34 age group , below the administration 's goal of roughly 40 percent .
The administration has said it needs to enroll roughly 7 million Americans by March 31 , on its way to expanding coverage to 25 million by 2016 .
However , Levitt said , “ It doesn ’ t matter how many people sign up . What matters more is the proportions . ”
And on Monday , Howard Dean -- a former Vermont governor , presidential candidate and Democratic National Committee chairman – suggested the so-called `` individual mandate '' in ObamaCare that requires Americans to purchase insurance or face a tax penalty might not have been needed for the program to be successful .
He told CNBC that actuarial data does not lead to the conclusion that huge cost overruns will result without the mandate .
`` Insurance companies like it because it does bring young , healthy people who are n't likely to get sick into the system , '' he said . `` But our experience [ in Vermont , ] although it 's with young people under 18 , not with everybody , is that the individual mandate was not that necessary . ''
