Donald Trump will release Muslim ban 2.0 … sometime soon . It ’ s totally coming , you guys . Absolutely . One of these days .
A White House official told reporters on Wednesday that the new order would come out ‘ sometime next week ’ – twice already this month , President Trump has made that same assurance to reporters , but nothing has yet been issued .
And it ’ s going to be great , the best Muslim ban ever , except for the last one .
“ Nothing was wrong with the first executive order , ” said White House Senior Policy Advisor Stephen Miller on Fox News , as he blamed a “ flawed judicial ruling ” that has held up implementation of the order . “ It ’ s still going to have the same basic policy outcome for the country , ” Miller said in an interview , without really giving any details on how it would change .
For people claiming that this ban is the only thing standing between the United States and a horde of terrorists and insisting that nothing much needs to change for the ban to pass muster with the courts , they sure aren ’ t in any hurry this time around . Maybe that ’ s because they know that in reality :
According to the New America Foundation , all 12 jihadist terrorists who have killed people in the United States since Sept. 11 , 2001 , were American citizens or permanent residents , and none had ties to the seven countries named in Mr. Trump ’ s executive order . Out of the nearly 400 non-deadly jihadist terrorist attacks on American soil since 9/11 , perpetrators were linked to Iran or Somalia in three cases .
They really might as well just put out whatever piece of trash they ’ ve already got prepared . It ’ s not going to get any easier to defend a ban on these specific countries , and all of the Trump camp ’ s statements that a Muslim ban was the goal are going to stay on the record for the courts to consider .
