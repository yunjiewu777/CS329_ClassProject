Obama needs a speech that rallies the faithful without losing credibility with the rest . Searching for an ACA shout-out
This time , President Barack Obama is going to have to actually talk about Obamacare in his State of the Union address .
No more touch-the-base-and-keep-running treatments , the way he ’ s handled it the past couple of years . This time , he ’ ll be expected to linger on base a bit , at least long enough to acknowledge the launch of the biggest domestic achievement of his presidency — and do it in the least awkward way possible .
That ’ s the consensus of Democratic strategists , health care experts , pollsters and crisis-management experts , all of whom will have reasons to listen closely when Obama brings up the health care law on Jan. 28 . It will be Obama ’ s most high-profile address since the clunky rollout began , and although it has come a long way since the worst days of October , it ’ s still not enough for him to say , “ Nailed it . ”
Instead , Obama will have to find an uplifting message about the law that doesn ’ t imply that everything ’ s suddenly back on track . The most he can say , based on the latest developments , is that “ it ’ s moving back toward the track , ” said Len Nichols , director of the Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics at George Mason University .
The federal enrollment website , HealthCare.gov , is working much better than it was in October , and sign-ups for private health coverage sped up dramatically in December . Now 3 million Americans have selected private health insurance plans , and there ’ s time for one more wave before enrollment ends March 31 . And CGI , the main contractor on the botched website , has been shown the door .
That doesn ’ t mean the Obama administration can put its fire extinguishers away though . The age mix isn ’ t right yet with too many older adults and not enough younger ones . The early sign-ups in the exchanges may not include a lot of actual uninsured people , although some have probably been added through Medicaid . Insurers are still waiting for the “ back end ” of the website , the part that handles their payments , to be built .
And HealthCare.gov ’ s Facebook page is loaded with complaints about enrollment problems , like customers who say they couldn ’ t get any proof of coverage from their insurance companies , couldn ’ t get coverage for their kids or are bouncing back and forth between the website and insurance call centers to try to resolve errors .
The bottom line : Obama needs a speech that rallies the faithful without losing credibility with the rest of the country .
There ’ s actually a fairly easy formula , according to the strategists and health care analysts , and it doesn ’ t require a radical departure from what Obama has already said about the law . He needs to say that millions of people have already signed up for coverage — though he shouldn ’ t overstate how many . He should say that millions more who already have health coverage have gotten new benefits , like preventive care with no copayments . He has acknowledged the bad rollout , but tell the law ’ s most enthusiastic supporters that “ we ’ ve turned the corner . ”
Most of all , Democratic strategists say , he has to revive his message that “ we ’ re not going back . ”
“ I don ’ t think he is going to try and resell that everything is perfect , but I would remind people that we can ’ t go back to a time when insurance companies were running the health care system and deciding who gets to participate , ” said Democratic pollster John Anzalone . “ No more getting denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions , no more being priced out of the marketplace because of DNA ( pre-existing conditions ) , no more lifetime limits , no more having to file bankruptcy because a family has a medical emergency . ”
Obama has said all of that before , but now that people are actually getting health coverage and other benefits , Democrats say the reminder is more important than ever .
“ Americans do not like having their rights taken away . And they do not like the idea of the GOP taking away their newfound health care rights , ” said Paul Begala , a former adviser to President Bill Clinton .
Health care didn ’ t occupy a lot of time in Obama ’ s last three State of the Union addresses since the law was signed . In 2011 , Obama acknowledged that the new House Republican majority hated the law , said it can always be improved but vowed never to go back to the days when insurance companies could turn people down because of pre-existing conditions . In 2012 and 2013 , Obamacare was reduced to a walk-on role — a couple of quick sentences , and that was it .
