Vice President Mike Pence on Friday said the Trump administration is “ putting the finishing touches ” on the GOP ’ s plan to overhaul health care , projecting a sense of party unity even as conservatives balk at the emerging plan as “ Obamacare lite . ”
Speaking in Wisconsin , Mr. Pence said the draft plan is being finalize over the weekend so Republicans can start to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in “ just a matter of days . ”
“ The Obamacare nightmare is about to end , ” said Mr. Pence in an appearance with President Trump ’ s health secretary , Tom Price , and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan in Janesville .
Republicans are trying to repeal and replace as much of the Affordable Care Act as they can under a fast-track budget process that allows them to avoid a Democratic filibuster .
Yet conservatives who could sink the effort are demanding to see legislative text , as leaders push a three-week timetable to dispatch a bill to the Senate , where it must meet arcane budget rules and gather consensus among Republicans who hold a 52-seat majority .
A trio of Senate conservatives — Mr. Paul of Kentucky , Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah — and vocal conservative groups have objected to the House GOP ’ s plan to provide refundable , age-based tax credits to people who purchase insurance on their own , while paying for it by taxing a portion of particularly generous employer-sponsored plans .
They ’ ve pushed a separate plan to let people deduct the cost of health insurance from the taxes they owe , rather than receiving a “ new entitlement ” from taxing others .
Yet House Speaker Paul D. Ryan has downplayed talk of rival plans . He said the draft plan being finalized received consensus support during the campaign , so it ’ s time to deliver .
The Energy and Commerce and tax-writing Ways and Means committees hope to begin marking up their legislation as soon as next week , though they haven ’ t committed to dates .
