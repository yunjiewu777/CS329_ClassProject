ObamaCare hit 3-million enrollees on Friday — still short of the number the administration had hoped for by the end of December — but reached only by including enrollees who have not yet made their first payment .
The insurance industry traditionally considers someone enrolled when they pay their first month ’ s premium .
Last week , the Department of Health and Human Services reported 24 % of the 2.2 million enrollees through Dec. 28 were between ages 18 and 34 . The Affordable Care Act ’ s survival depends on younger , and presumably more healthy , enrollees to sign up for care to keep insurance pools balanced .
Under the ACA , every individual in the country has to have insurance by April 1 -- the end of open enrollment period -- or they will face a $ 95 fine , or 1 % of their annual income for failing to comply .
“ We are encouraged that millions of people have been enrolled in Marketplace or Medicaid coverage since October 1 , and will work to give millions more Americans the peace of mind that comes with health security in the months ahead , ” Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner said in a release .
Devon Herrick , senior analyst at the National Center for Policy Analysis , says the report continues to leave out two key statistics : premium payments and demographics .
“ We knew and assumed that as we got closer to the first of the year , more people would go online , especially as the administration ironed out the bugs in the exchange software and website , ” Herrick says . “ It does make sense that as they can , more people will go online . ”
But fears of adverse selection , which is when older and sicker people making up the majority of enrollees , remains .
“ The administration seems to be quietly worried about that as well , ” he says . “ Hopefully the late enrollees are younger people . ”
