The verdict is in , and it ’ s not good : Obamacare is rippling through the U.S. economy with vast implications for American prosperity .
On Friday , we learned that the Obama economy has hit stall speed , with a paltry 113,000 jobs added in January .
Two days earlier , we learned the president ’ s health care law is discouraging Americans from working , according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office . The report makes for bracing reading . The law will reduce the labor supply by the equivalent of 2.3 million full-time workers , the CBO says — up from an estimated 800,000 just three years ago .
It gets worse . The CBO also concluded that the law ’ s “ expanded Medicaid eligibility … will , on balance , reduce incentives to work. ” Think about that : Obamacare is giving low-income Americans fewer reasons to work — to find and pursue the jobs that could transform their lives and the lives of those around them . The president talks a lot about tackling inequality . But his health care law is a recipe for increasing inequality , not decreasing it .
Obamacare ’ s Medicaid expansion doesn ’ t just discourage work ; it also prioritizes coverage for able-bodied adults over the needs of persons with disabilities . That ’ s a dirty little secret the Obama administration and its liberal allies , in their rush to expand government-funded health coverage to millions more Americans , won ’ t tell you . And it ’ s yet another reason why states should resist the siren song of the administration and its leftist supporters , who plan to spend 2014 persuading them to embrace the expansion .
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation , in 2012 more than half a million seniors and people with disabilities on state Medicaid lists were awaiting access to home and community-based services . Prompt access to these services could keep individuals with disabilities out of institutions , which are often more costly .
Yet Obamacare provides states with a much greater federal Medicaid match — 100 percent for the first three years , phasing down to 90 percent over time — to cover previously ineligible low-income individuals . According to the Urban Institute , nearly five in six adults to be covered under the Medicaid expansion are adults without children , most in their prime working years .
In other words , Obamacare ’ s incentive structure places a greater emphasis on expanding coverage to these able-bodied adults — the vast majority of whom could be working or preparing for work — than helping the individuals with disabilities Medicaid was initially created to serve .
That ’ s not compassionate — just the opposite , in fact . So while the president ’ s advisers ask why states aren ’ t expanding Medicaid under Obamacare , I have another question for President Obama : Why is expanding Medicaid to cover millions of working-age Americans a bigger priority than giving access to hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities waiting for care ?
