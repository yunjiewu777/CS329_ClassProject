Contrary to news reports , comprehensive immigration reform is not splintering the Republican Party , Reince Priebus , chairman of the Republican National Committee , tells ███ TV . `` It 's bizarre . I do n't find it to be dividing the party , '' Priebus tells ███ in an exclusive interview . `` What you have is a consensus in the party that we need immigration reform , and everyone agrees on it . `` He notes how the issue has brought together members of the party with such divergent views as Sens . Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina . `` Now , we know that Rand Paul 's version of what that looks like is going to be different than Lindsey Graham 's , but you do have consensus in the party that we need serious immigration reform , '' Priebus said.In June , the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill on a 68-32 vote that was backed by 14 Republicans . It includes provisions for a pathway to citizenship and increased border security.The vote , which came on legislation introduced by the bipartisan Gang of Eight senators in April , sent the bill to the House of Representatives for consideration.But the GOP-controlled House has said that it will not vote on such a huge Senate bill , opting instead to address immigration reform through individual pieces of legislation.And House Speaker John Boehner , who vowed that the lower chamber would not take an `` Obamacare-like '' approach to immigration reform , has pledged to not bring any such legislation to the floor unless it has the support of most of his party 's members.Republicans have consistently attacked the Senate bill , saying it amounts to little more than amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants , that it does little to strengthen the nation 's borders , and that the Senate Democratic leadership was rushing complex legislation into law.Priebus says he is not sure what form any final legislation would take , but it should address such issues as tougher border security , worker visas – an enhanced E-Verify system — and a discussion on the legalization of people who are already here . `` Maybe not necessarily citizenship , but certainly a good , strong debate over the issue of legalization , and most people in the party are ready for that conversation .
