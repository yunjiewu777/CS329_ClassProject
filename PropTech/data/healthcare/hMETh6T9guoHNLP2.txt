President Obama on Friday defended his signature health care law and lambasted Republican-led threats to dismantle the reforms , a public attempt to navigate his recent decision to delay one of the law ’ s key mandates and wave off a burgeoning threat to shut down the government over the controversial law .
“ The one unifying principle in the Republican Party at the moment is making sure that 30 million people don ’ t have health care , ” he said in a White House press conference before his family leaves for vacation on Martha ’ s Vineyard , Mass .
“ There ’ s not even a pretense now that they ’ re going to replace it with something better , ” he added .
Mr. Obama was responding to critics of his July 2 decision to delay the law ’ s “ employer mandate , ” which requires employers of 50 or more full-time workers to provide health coverage or pay fines , without offering relief to everyday Americans subject to the law ’ s “ individual mandate ” to purchase insurance .
He said the decision was based on business leaders ’ concerns about the reporting requirements tied to the mandate . Normally , he said , he would approach Republican leaders and say they need to tweak the law .
“ But we ’ re not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to quote-unquote Obamacare , ” he told reporters .
Republican aides laughed off the president ’ s assertions in a battery of Twitter messages .
The Republican-led House , they said , was more than willing to pass a bill that codified the employer-mandate delay into law .
Mr. Obama also downplayed a movement promoted by conservative groups and outspoken Republican Sens . Mike Lee of Utah , Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida to strike down any spending deals this September that include funding for the president ’ s health care law .
Mr. Obama said Americans have no patience for a government shutdown and that “ common sense will prevail . ”
“ We ’ ll see what happens , ” he said . “ We ’ ve got a couple months . ”
