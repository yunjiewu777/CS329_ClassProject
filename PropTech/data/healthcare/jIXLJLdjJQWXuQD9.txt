Even if the Supreme Court upholds the federal health care overhaul , Republicans are vowing to fight for its repeal .
Rep. Bill Cassidy , R-La. , in the party 's weekly radio and Internet address Saturday , rallied GOP lawmakers to sustain the fight against the law if any of it is left on the table following a landmark ruling expected as early as Monday .
`` Unless the court throws out the entire law , we should repeal what is left and implement common sense step-by-step reforms that protect Americans ' access to the care they need from the doctor they choose at the lowest cost , '' Cassidy said .
Cassidy claimed the law is hurting job growth , `` making it harder for small businesses to hire workers '' by driving up health care costs .
`` The only way to change this is by repealing ObamaCare entirely , '' he said .
Cassidy 's address is the latest entry in a sustained effort by both parties to telegraph a post-ruling game-plan to the rank-and-file .
Earlier in the week , House Speaker John Boehner circulated a memo telling members `` there will be no spiking of the ball '' if the law is struck down .
Boehner called for pursuing step-by-step reforms . Cassidy , too , said Republicans would pursue a replacement law whether or not the Supreme Court upholds the overhaul .
He complained that the law has not curbed the rise in health care costs , and called for a plan to achieve that .
Democrats issued a memo of their own this past week , pointing out that several popular provisions of the bill , such as the prohibition on lifetime coverage limits and the ability for young people to stay on their parents ' insurance until age 26 , are already in effect .
President Obama , speaking Friday to an audience of Latino officials in Florida , also defended the law -- saying it was `` wrong '' to allow insurance companies to raise premiums at will and `` right '' to make health care available to all Americans .
`` That was the right thing to do , '' the president said .
