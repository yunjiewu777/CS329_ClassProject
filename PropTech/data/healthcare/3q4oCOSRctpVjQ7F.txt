The second enrollment period at HealthCare.gov began Saturday , and so far , it 's gone much more smoothly than the start of last year 's first open enrollment , which was full of glitches and saw only a handful of people able to enroll the first day .
The Department of Health and Human Services said that on Saturday alone , more than 100,000 people applied for healthcare on the site , and more than half a million people logged on .
NPR 's Elise Hu previously reported that the healthcare.gov users are seeing this weekend is a substantially faster , better website that it was last year :
Its load times have improved substantially , and the administration says it can handle twice as much traffic volume as last year . For customers shopping for coverage , you actually browse plans â€” get a sense of what they cost , check eligibility for tax credits ... and decide whether you want to buy .
Hu also found that the site has a new system in place to detect traffic overloads faster , and programmers from the Department of Homeland Security are trying to hack the site to make sure it 's safe .
Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell went on NBC 's Meet The Press Sunday and said the website works . `` I think the vast majority of people coming to the site were able to get on and do what they were intending to do , '' said Burwell .
But she admitted that even as the number of Americans without health insurance continues to drop , and as more Americans began to take advantage of some of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act , lots of Americans are still dissatisfied with the law .
`` I think one of the things we need to do is translate that success , '' said Burwell . `` Because I think when you ask the American people about those things individually , or when you ask the American people about the importance of no longer being held off healthcare because of preexisting conditions , or the fact that their children up to the age 26 can be on their plans ... When you ask them about the substance of the issue , the American people respond positively . And that 's what I think we need to do more about . ''
Polling on the ACA continues to find that about half of Americans have negative feelings about the law , though people who enroll in plans through government exchanges are generally satisfied with their coverage .
Meanwhile , comments made by one of the architects of the law continues to draw criticism . Video recently surfaced of MIT economist Jonathan Gruber saying the `` stupidity of the American voter '' helped get the law passed . The Obama administration has already distanced itself from Gruber 's statements , and Republicans are strongly condemning the remarks .
But that might be less of a problem for the ACA than the new Congress , which will have both chambers controlled by Republicans in its new term . Several members of the party say repealing Obamacare will be their first order of business .
