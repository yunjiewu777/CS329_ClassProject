When Obamacare was shoved down the throats of the American people in 2010 , doctors , people in the medical industry and conservatives warned the legislation would be a major job killer and guess what ? It is .
Last month we saw the Cleveland Clinic , a place Obama touted as the future of healthcare , cutting jobs in order to prepare for Obamacare .
The world-renowned Cleveland Clinic said on Wednesday it would cut jobs and slash five to six percent of its $ 6 billion annual budget to prepare for President Barack Obama 's health reforms .
The clinic , which has treated celebrities and world leaders such as musician Lou Reed , former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and former Olympic gold medal skater Scott Hamilton , did not say how many of its 44,000 employees would be laid off . But a spokeswoman said that $ 330 million would be cut from its annual budget .
Health care providers announced more layoffs than any other industry last month — 8,128 — largely because of reductions by hospitals , according to outplacement firm Challenger Gray and Christmas . So far this year , the health care sector has announced 41,085 layoffs , the third-most behind financial and industrial companies .
Total private hospital employment is still up by 36,000 in the past 12 months , but it 's down by 8,000 since April , and more staff reductions are expected into next year .
This month , Indiana University Health laid off about 900 workers as part of a move to trim its budget by $ 1 billion over five years . Vanderbilt plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs by the end of the year to help shave operating costs 8 % a year .
Now , major hospitals around the country are doing the same . During the most recent battle over the budget , it seemed like the medical device industry may get some kind of relief from Obamacare through a repeal of the medical device tax , something both Democrats and Republicans support . But due to partisan bickering and Harry Reid 's refusal to consider Obamacare could be killing jobs and entire industries , the tax still stands , companies keep cutting jobs and the medical device brain drain continues .
But not only does this tax increase costs on companies , it also increases costs on hospitals , doctors and people in need of medical treatment that requires medical devices to be used . As a consequence of this , biomedical or medical device engineering firms are already laying off workers who develop crucial medical products due to the `` unforeseen '' costs , or in other words , the costs of ObamaCare . Not to mention , the more money these companies pay to the government , the less money they have to invest in research and development .
With this new medical device tax , students who pay large sums of money to get degrees in the field of biomedical engineering , just like doctors , will no longer see the benefits of going into the field and therefore , we will have a shortage of engineers developing new medical device technology . The medical device tax is a death sentence for American medical innovation .
So , what does this all mean ? Get ready for the inevitable and previously predicted doctor shortage .
