While all eyes are on the ObamaCare rollout , an ambitious health care experiment is going forward in Vermont that would create a government-run alternative know as a `` single-payer '' system -- and it 's starting to attract more attention from liberals frustrated with the Affordable Care Act 's implementation .
Democrats ' faith in ObamaCare has been shaken by the technical failures of the federal and state insurance exchanges as well as , in some cases , premium increases . In Vermont , however , they see a potential first step toward the kind of national government-run health care system some have advocated for years . Filmmaker Michael Moore , in a column last week blasting ObamaCare , said Vermont 's plan could `` change everything . ''
But critics say the proposal goes too far and would kill thousands of jobs . `` It ’ s not practical , ” Vermont state Rep. Patti Komline , who voted against the plan , told FoxNews.com . “ There are too many complications involved . ”
A single-payer plan would largely sideline the insurance industry , and instead set up a government-managed insurance system to collect all health care fees and pay out all health care costs .
Full implementation of Vermont ’ s single-payer plan could be held up for another three years , at least . In order for Green Mountain Care to fully launch in 2017 , the health care exchange would have to get approval from the federal government to use federal money to fund the state program .
State law would also require Vermont to define the benefits of the single-payer program and provide a three-year budget that clocks in less than current health care costs .
University of Virginia public policy professor Raymond Scheppach said it will take another half decade to determine whether Vermont ’ s controversial plan even works and if there are any real benefits associated with it . He also says that regardless of outcome , Vermont ’ s political makeup differs from other states and therefore would not provide an accurate view of what ’ s to come .
The single-payer debate recently resurfaced in national headlines following the Dec. 31 op-ed piece in the New York Times by Moore . In it , Moore called ObamaCare “ awful ” and said liberals have avoided speaking in public about the problems with it because they didn ’ t want to provide the president ’ s critics with additional ammunition .
Moore went on to sing the merits of a single-payer system and said that the real problem with ObamaCare is that it is a “ pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer , Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go . ”
Supporters say the single-payer system would cut down on the administrative waste and complications associated with having multiple billers and billing systems . Opponents say such a widespread overhaul would be bad for business .
Vermont became the first state in the country to lay the groundwork for single-payer health care . Gov . Peter Shumlin , a Democrat , signed the plan into law in May 2011 .
The initiative , which was approved by the Democratic-controlled House and Senate , promises to extend coverage to all of Vermont ’ s 620,000 residents , of which around 47,000 residents are uninsured and 150,000 are underinsured .
`` This law recognizes an economic and fiscal imperative , '' Shumlin said during a press conference when he signed the bill . `` We must control the growth in health care costs that are putting families at economic risk and making it harder for small employers to do business . ”
The exchange , Green Mountain Care , will set reimbursement rates for health care providers and streamline administration into a single , unified system .
Some experts say a revised system would save an estimated $ 580 million annually , and $ 1.9 billion by 2019 . But the single-payer system ’ s creator , Harvard economist William Hsiao , says it could generate even greater profits for Vermont .
Hsiao predicts his plan would save the state 25.3 percent a year in total health care spending , lower household and employer health care spending , boost job growth and create a higher economic output for the state .
The savings , he said in a 2011 Health Affairs article , would come from tort reform for malpractice suits , better governance and lower administrative expenses . Vermont would rack up $ 4.6 billion in savings during the first five years of the program which he says would be used in part to cover the state ’ s uninsured as well as to expand benefits and services .
Vermont ’ s health care spending runs about $ 5 billion annually , with costs rising between 6.5 percent and 8.5 percent in recent years .
But not everyone is on board with the plan . It is still unknown how Vermont will pay for the plan and whether that money will come from additional taxes on its residents .
Komline says despite the plan 's passage , she doesn ’ t see Vermont residents warming up to the idea of a single-payer system any time soon . She also said that Vermont , because of its small size and political makeup , is open to influence from special interest groups .
“ It doesn ’ t take much money for special interest groups to come in and influence votes , ” she said . “ That ’ s why Vermont was among the first to legalize pot and same-sex marriages . ”
Calls to the governor 's office for comment were not returned .
