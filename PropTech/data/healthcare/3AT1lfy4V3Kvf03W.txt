House Speaker John Boehner said something noteworthy at the recent House Republican retreat on Maryland ’ s Eastern Shore : “ It ’ s important that we show the American people we ’ re not just the opposition party , we ’ re actually the alternative party . ”
To be sure , there ’ s nothing wrong with opposing ; the phrase “ loyal opposition ” boasts a distinguished lineage in English parliamentary history , as well as American congressional history .
However , opposing only gets you half the way there ; blocking the other side ’ s forward motion is not the same as making forward motion yourself . So yes , opposing is fine—but winning is better . And winning , as Boehner said , requires the power of a superior alternative .
Continuing , Boehner added , “ We ’ ve passed dozens of bills this year to help the economy , to help improve education , improve energy production in America ” —but then noted that most of these bills then went into limbo in the Democratically-controlled Senate .
Boehner also declared , “ Republicans have to do more to talk about the better solutions we think we have that will help the American people grow their wages and opportunities at a better job and clearly have a better shot at the American dream . ”
Yes , ObamaCare may continue to unravel , and yes , the economy may be softening . Even The New York Times had to concede that the recent jobs report was “ a disappointing showing that is likely to spur fears that the labor market is poised for yet another slowdown . ''
But the GOP still must demonstrate that it can do more than just say “ no. ” And so some core Republican ideas are starting to break through .
For example , there ’ s a decent chance that Obama will approve the Keystone Pipeline . And if he doesn ’ t , well , Republicans have effectively framed the Keystone debate as a jobs issue , and jobs are popular ; a recent poll found that 56 percent of Americans support the pipeline , while just 41 percent oppose it . So for the sake of the Democrats in Congress , Obama would be well advised to endorse the pipeline .
On another issue as well , the GOP message is breaking through . In his 2014 State of the Union address , Obama called for tax reform , declaring , “ Let ’ s work together to close those loopholes , end those incentives to ship jobs overseas , and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home . ”
In other words , lower the rate and broaden the base , in the same way that Ronald Reagan worked with Congressional Democrats to enact tax reform in 1986 . ( I am the co-chair of the RATE Coalition , a bipartisan group working to make the U.S. corporate tax code more competitive . )
OK , so those are issues that the GOP has traditionally been associated with : more energy production and a more jobs -- and a business-friendly tax code .
But Democrats have other issues . For example , there ’ s health care , specifically , national health insurance . That ’ s been a core Democratic issue , going back to the 1940s , when President Truman first proposed it , later followed , of course , by President Clinton in the 1990s . And without a doubt , the cause of national health insurance helped Obama win in 2008 .
Yet today , the situation has changed ; polls show that a majority of Americans disapprove of ObamaCare .
Still , for Republicans , there ’ s the issue of providing an alternative . Can Republicans do it ? The answer seems to be , yes , they can .
Late last month , Republican Senators Richard Burr of North Carolina , Tom Coburn of Oklahoma , and Orrin Hatch of Utah released a market-oriented alternative to Obamacare , the Patient CARE Act . As Burr explained ,
“ The Patient CARE proposal repeals Obamacare and focuses on targeted reforms that will lower costs and expand access to quality care . We can lower costs and expand access to quality coverage and care by empowering individuals and their families to make their own health care decisions , rather than empowering the government to make those decisions for them . ”
The Burr-Coburn-Hatch legislation has been stopped cold , of course , by the Democratic majority in the Senate .
Yet that could change ; The Washington Post recently reported on a statistical model that showed that the GOP has a better-than-even chance of winning the Senate this November .
In the meantime , Burr , Coburn , and Hatch have helped Republican prospects by doing something both intellectually responsible and politically astute : They have put a credible health insurance plan on the table . In other words , the Republicans aren ’ t just the party of “ no to ObamaCare , ” they are the party of “ yes to a sound health insurance alternative . ”
We might further note that health care consists of a lot more than insurance . Even more fundamental is the issue of health itself . As noted here at ███ Opinion last February , House Majority Leader Eric Cantor spoke out on the value of cures :
“ Long term , controlling health care costs will require smarter federal investments in medical research . Many of today ’ s cures and life saving treatments are a result of an initial federal investment . And much of it is spent on cancer research and other grave illnesses . ”
In other words , medical research and cures are the key to holding down health care costs . The logic is simple : To cite just one medical example , if tens of millions of Americans develop Alzheimer ’ s Disease , then the costs will be so astronomical—some $ 1 trillion a year by mid-century—as to overwhelm any kind of health insurance at all , public or private .
The blunt reality is this : If current trends continue , treating major diseases is going to be unaffordable . And so that leaves us with only one humane and ethical solution : Don ’ t just treat the disease , cure the disease .
Earlier this month , House Energy & Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton , ( R-Mich. ) , added his public voice to the cure-cause . Upton took note of a new collaboration between 10 big pharmaceutical companies and the National Institutes of Health , aimed at achieving breakthrough cures for dreaded diseases , including Alzheimer ’ s , diabetes , lupus , and arthritis .
The Wolverine State Republican , who has been a major behind-the-scenes mover in these pro-cure efforts , declared ,
“ The search for cures must be an all-hands-on-deck effort . This landmark effort exemplifies the very best of a public-private collaboration , and we in Congress also want to do what we can in the name of breakthrough research . ”
Yes , as Upton said , we need “ breakthrough research ” leading to cures . A cure , making the illness go away , is infinitely superior to mere care .
Republicans now have a double-barreled approach to health care . Thanks to Burr , Coburn , and Hatch , they have a solid ObamaCare alternative . And thanks to Cantor and Upton , they have a new vision of cures and hope .
For lots of reasons , including a stronger health care message , things are looking up for the GOP , 2014-wise .
After that , the Republican challenge will be to find a strong messenger who can keep faith with familiar GOP issues while also carrying the new double health care message into the 2016 presidential election .
