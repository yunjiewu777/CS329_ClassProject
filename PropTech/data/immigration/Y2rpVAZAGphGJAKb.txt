As soon as 26 states took it upon themselves to sue President Obama over the sensible , humane executive actions he took in late 2014 to protect millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation , it was inevitable that the lawsuit would land on the Supreme Court ’ s doorstep .
On Tuesday morning , the justices announced that they would hear the case , which means a decision will most likely come down by the end of June . The states should never have been allowed standing to sue in the first place , and their substantive claims are groundless .
There are more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States . No one , besides Donald Trump , believes the nation has the resources , or the will , to deport them all . The clearest solution is to focus on removing those who pose an actual threat to public safety while deferring action on most of the rest and helping them “ come out of the shadows. ” In 2012 , the Obama administration allowed young immigrants who were brought here as children to be given work permits and be exempted from deportation , a program that has worked well . In November 2014 , the president announced a plan to offer work permits and a three-year reprieve from deportation to as many as five million undocumented parents of American citizens or permanent residents , provided they had no criminal record and had lived in the country at least five years .
Getting hardworking people who have deep roots in their communities out of the shadows isn ’ t a new issue . In a 1980 presidential debate , George Bush decried the harsh efforts to marginalize undocumented immigrants . “ We ’ re creating a whole society of really honorable , decent , family-loving people that are in violation of the law , ” he said . Mr. Obama , along with other reality-based politicians on both the left and the right , understands this , but congressional Republicans have refused to pass any meaningful immigration reform .
