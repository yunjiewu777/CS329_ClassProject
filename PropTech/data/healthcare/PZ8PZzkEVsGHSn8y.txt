Members of the House Freedom Caucus stood with Sen. Rand Paul ( R.-Ky. ) Tuesday to denounce the Obamacare replacement bill supported by House Speaker Paul Ryan ( R.-Wis. ) and to announce the filing of Paul ’ s own bill , which is sponsored in the House by Rep. Jim Jordan ( R.-Ohio ) .
“ There is one thing that has united Republicans in 2010 , when we won the House ; in 2014 , when we won the Senate ; and 2016 when we won the White House , ” said Paul , who was flanked by members of the House Freedom Caucus , including the caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows ( R.-N.C. ) and Jordan , the previous HFC chairman .
A clean repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) , like the bill that every House and Senate Republican voted for in 2015 , should not divide Republicans , he said .
Jordan said in order to bring down costs and improve medical care , Congress must repeal Obamacare completely .
The Ohio congressman said the first step is to vote on the 2015 bill .
Paul , who was a practising eye surgeon before his 2010 election to Congress , said in 2017 Republicans are united supporting complete repeal , but they are divided on how , if at all , to replace the 2010 PPACA .
“ Conservatives have a replacement plan . House leadership has a replacement plan , ” he said . “ Vote on all the replacement plans and let ’ s see what happens . ”
Jordan said the plan supported by Ryan and the House Republican leadership is Obamacare in a different form .
“ Then , there is our plan , ” he said . “ It is the one that I think is consistent with what we told the voters we ’ re going to do : Repeal Obamacare and replace it with a market-centered , patient-centered , and doctor-centered plan that actually brings down the cost of insurance . ”
In 2015 , Republicans put a bill on President Barack Obama ’ s desk that repealed Obamacare , got rid of every single tax , and got rid of the mandate , Jordan said . Obama vetoed that bill , which was sponsored by then-Rep. Tom Price ( R.-Ga. ) — now the Secretary of Health and Human Services .
Compare what happened in 2015 with the course that Ryan and the Republican leadership have set out on , Jordan said .
“ Now , the first thing that Republicans are bringing forward is a piece of legislation that we are going to put on a Republican president ’ s desk , that doesn ’ t repeal it , but keeps Medicaid expansion–and actually expands it–that keeps some of the tax increases . That is not what we promised the American people we would do . ”
Meadows said repealing Obamacare meant repealing all of Obamacare , all of the fees , taxes , and mandates .
All Obamacare replacement bills will be subject to scoring by the Congressional Budget Office . “ But there is one score that the American people will pay attention to : Does it really lower their health care costs and their premiums ? That ’ s the only score that really matters and if this doesn ’ t do it , we better find something that does , ” according to Meadows .
Paul told reporters that in the House the score that counts is 218 votes .
If the GOP leadership has 218 votes , then they will pass their bill and move on , he said .
If the GOP leadership does not have 218 votes , then they have to find the votes and they will have to talk to conservatives , the senator said .
Vice President Mike Pence added to the day ’ s drama when he met with members of the House Freedom Caucus after having his regular Tuesday lunch with GOP senators .
Virginia Republican Rep. David Brat told ███ the meeting with Pence was very direct and focused because both Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price , who was traveling with Pence , are men of the House .
Brat said he told Price that he needs to convince people on the Hill that regulations on insurance companies will be adjusted to make sense .
Case in point , the congresman said : it is not legal for a 25-year-old male to buy a cheap insurance plan that only covers catastrophic illness and injury . “ Right now , that kid has to buy a gold-plated that covers every health scenario under the sun . ”
The White House put out a statement about the meeting :
The Vice President today met with conservative leaders in the House to discuss the failures of Obamacare and the need to repeal and replace that disastrous law . Participants discussed their shared desire for fiscally responsible , market-based reforms that encourage competition and provide individuals and families with the ability to choose the health insurance option that is best for them . The Vice President stressed this is the first step in the process to deliver on the President ’ s promise to the American people and looks forward to House passage of the American Health Care Act .
The American Health Care Act is the name of the bill supported by House GOP leadership .
