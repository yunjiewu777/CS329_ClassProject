( ███ ) - The U.S. death toll from the novel coronavirus on Tuesday exceeded the 58,220 American lives lost during the Vietnam War as cases topped 1 million , according to a ███ tally .
U.S. cases have doubled in 18 days and make up one-third of all infections in the world , according to the tally .
The actual number of cases is thought to be higher , with state public health officials cautioning that shortages of trained workers and materials have limited testing capacity .
About 30 % of the cases have occurred in New York state , the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak , followed by New Jersey , Massachusetts , California and Pennsylvania .
The U.S. death toll since the first death recorded on Feb. 29 reached 58,233 on Tuesday , up more than 2,000 from the prior day .
The outbreak could take more than 74,000 U.S. lives by Aug. 4 , compared with an April 22 forecast of over 67,600 , according to the University of Washington 's predictive model here often cited by White House officials .
Globally , coronavirus cases top 3 million since the outbreak began in China late last year . The United States , with the world ’ s third-largest population , has five times as many cases as the next hardest-hit countries of Italy , Spain and France .
Of the 20 most severely affected countries , the United States ranks fifth based on cases per capita , according to a ███ tally . The United States has about 30 cases per 10,000 people . Spain ranks first at over 48 cases per 10,000 people , followed by Belgium , Switzerland and Italy .
In addition to exceeding the Vietnam War toll , the U.S. toll for the coronavirus tops the number of deaths from seasonal flu in recent years , except for the 2017-2018 season , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) here
Flu deaths range from a low of 12,000 in the 2011-2012 season to a high of 61,000 during 2017-2018 .
The coronavirus deaths in the United States fall short of the approximately 100,000 Americans killed by seasonal flu in 1967 , according to the CDC . It is also far less deadly than the Spanish flu , which began in 1918 and killed 675,000 Americans .
Unprecedented stay-at-home orders to try to curb the spread of the virus have hammered the economy , with the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits over the last five weeks soaring to 26.5 million .
About a dozen states are beginning to relax the stay-at-home restrictions despite the warning of health experts that premature actions could cause a surge in new cases .
A ███/Ipsos survey this month found that a bipartisan majority of Americans want to go on sheltering in place to protect themselves from the coronavirus , despite the impact on the economy .
