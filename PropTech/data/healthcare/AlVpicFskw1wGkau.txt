President Obama says that the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. “ would like ” the Affordable Care Act that is set to kick in this fall and that has become a top target of Republicans .
Speaking on the eve of the commemoration ceremony for the 50th anniversary of Mr. King ’ s “ I Have a Dream ” speech set for Wednesday in Washington , Mr. Obama was asked what the civil rights leader would say about the Affordable Care Act , which passed in 2010 and has become known as Obamacare .
“ Oh , he would like that , ” Mr. Obama told Tom Joyner and Sybil Wilkes during an interview in the Oval Office . “ Well , because I think he understood that health care , health security is not a privilege ; it ’ s something that in a country as wealthy as ours , everybody should have access to . ”
Mr. Obama said that starting Oct. 1 people without health insurance will be able to get it at an affordable rate and that the cost of free prevention and free checkups for a lot of people will be “ cheaper than your cell phone bill . ”
“ And , if heaven forbid you get sick or some family member gets sick , even if you have a preexisting condition , you know that you ’ re going to have the security — you ’ re not going to lose your house , you ’ re not going to suddenly go bankrupt , and you ’ re going to be able to get the treatment that you need , ” he said . “ So the key is going to be just signing folks up . ”
The Obama administration has been working to set up state-based health exchanges , where qualified consumers without employer-based health coverage may buy insurance through the help of government subsidies , in time for the start of open enrollment on Oct. 1 .
