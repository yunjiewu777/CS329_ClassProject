Insurers have raised concerns that too few young people are signing up for heath insurance through the ObamaCare exchanges after newly released statistics showed that less than a quarter of people who have enrolled are between the ages of 18 and 34 .
According to the numbers released Monday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , only 24 percent – or 489,460 – of the 2.2 million people who signed up for ACA were in the coveted 18-to-34 age range . That means the government has hit only 18 percent of its stated goal of registering 2.7 million adults in the 18-to-34 age range .
Experts have predicted that the program will need roughly 40 percent of enrollees to be in that prime demographic in order to be fiscally solvent . Adults ages 55 to 64 made up 33 percent of the total number of Americans who signed up , the largest group represented in the data .
ObamaCare needs so-called 'invincibles ' -- healthy young adults -- to sign up in coming months to help offset the costs of older and less healthy enrollees . If that doesn ’ t happen , insurers could be forced to raise the rates , making the costs and future of ObamaCare uncertain .
`` This is concerning to us that we 're seeing this portion come in so old , '' Marty Anderson , marketing director for Wisconsin-based Security Health Plan , told the Wall Street Journal .
Allan Einboden , chief executive of Scott & White Health Plan , told the Journal that the data was `` more negative than we thought it was going to be , '' and added that several requests to pre-authorize surgeries for enrollees in the first days of their coverage had executives worried about costs .
Robert Laszewski , a consultant who works with insurers , told The New York Times that `` You need healthy people of all ages ... the program is not ramping up fast enough to guarantee a good balance of healthy and sick people , which you need to sustain the program . ''
Administration officials , though , were upbeat in describing the numbers Monday . They said they 're in a `` solid place , '' and noted that this age group makes up just 26 percent of the general population .
Monday ’ s report was the first time the government has released demographic data on the performance of President Obama ’ s signature health care overhaul . In all , about 1.8 million people enrolled in new individual health plans through the law in December , bringing the total number of new enrollments between Oct. 1 and Dec.28 to about 2.2 million .
`` There 's no way to spin it : youth enrollment has been a bust so far , '' Brendan Buck , a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner , said in a statement following the release . `` When they see that ObamaCare offers high costs for limited access to doctors – if the enrollment goes through at all – it 's no surprise that young people are n't rushing to sign up . ''
As analysts have told ███ , insurance companies have said they may want to take advantage of the `` risk pool '' provisions -- which involve the federal government covering 80 percent of any losses associated with an older and unhealthier base of customers .
According to HHS , 79 percent of ObamaCare customers selected a plan with financial assistance . While only 2.2 million people have actually signed up , 44.5 million called or visited state and federal websites .
Of the 2.2 million who have signed up , 54 percent are female and 46 percent are male , HHS said .
Individuals and families are able to choose from four plans offered through the federal marketplace -- bronze , silver , gold and platinum .
Sixty percent selected a silver plan , while 20 percent selected a bronze plan , according to HHS .
