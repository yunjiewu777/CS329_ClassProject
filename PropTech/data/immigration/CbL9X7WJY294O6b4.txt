SAN DIEGO — Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly , Attorney General Sessions , and Sen. Ron Johnson ( R-WI ) concluded a visit to the border on Friday with a tough message for “ sanctuary city ” jurisdictions , including California .
Standing on an access road on the U.S. side of the border , Secretary Kelly began a press briefing by reaffirming the Trump administration ’ s commitment to border security , including a “ physical barrier ” along the southern border .
He also emphasized the importance of stopping human trafficking along the border . “ There ’ s nothing the Attorney General and I want more than to put human smugglers out of business , ” he said .
Kelly cited drastic reductions in the number of illegal border crossings , which he said were down 64 % from the same period last year . The reason , he said , was that the Trump administration had shown “ we ’ re serious about border security and enforcing our immigration laws . ”
Attorney General Sessions spoke about the boost in morale among law enforcement staff , and praised the progress of the Trump administration . “ It ’ s exceeded what I thought possible so far , ” Sessions said .
He warned about the danger of infiltration by gangs like MS-13 , “ whose motto is ‘ murder , rape , and control , ' ” he said .
And then the Attorney General launched a broadside against sanctuary cities — and the would-be “ sanctuary state ” of California .
“ It was nearly two years ago that Kate Steinle was shot and killed , dying in her father ’ s arms , along Pier 14 in San Francisco , ” Attorney General Sessions recalled . “ The alleged shooter was an illegal immigrant with seven prior felony convictions who had been deported from this country five times . Only weeks earlier , the city had released him from custody , after being apprehended again , even though the federal immigration authorities had filed a detainer requesting that he be held in custody until they could remove him for deportation proceedings . Even worse , this man admitted he came to San Francisco in part because of its sanctuary policies .
“ So today , the Department of Justice sent letters to nine jurisdictions that were identified — by the Obama administration — as having policies that potentially violate federal law and which receive millions in federal grants . These jurisdictions have until June 30th to send their legal justifications for why they are not in violation of federal law — and the state of California is one of these jurisdictions . … Sanctuary jurisdictions have put known gang members back on the streets . ”
He concluded : “ I urge New York , California , and other jurisdictions to reconsider . ”
The California State Senate recently passed a “ sanctuary state ” bill , SB 54 , that still awaits passage by the State Assembly before proceeding to Governor Jerry Brown ’ s desk .
Kelly , Sessions , and Johnson were concluding a two-day visit to the border , which began in El Paso , Texas on Thursday and concluded in San Diego at the Otai Mesa Detention Facility .
The press conference was held in between two existing border fences — a thin , rusted corrugated iron fence on the Mexican side , and a tall , razor-wire-topped American fence . In the distance , the new pedestrian walkway between Tijuana ’ s airport and San Diego hovered over the boundary .
Johnson , who serves as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs , said : “ One of the main reasons we come here , in addition to learning … is to thank the men and women ” of law enforcement .
He reiterated that the Trump administration , in contrast to his predecessor , had prioritized helping border patrol and enforcing the law .
“ We ’ re not going to apologize , ” he said , for enforcing the law and keeping the country safe .
Asked by a local reporter to respond to the argument by sanctuary cities that enforcing immigration law would hurt local policing , Sessions described that as more of an “ excuse ” than a reason , suggesting that it was driven by ideology rather than evidence .
He rejected an accusation earlier Friday by California State Senate President pro Tem Kevin De León ( D-Los Angeles ) that he and the Department of Justice were basing their law enforcement efforts on “ principles of white supremacy . ”
“ It ’ s a kind of extremist statement that I totally reject , ” Sessions said .
He also defended his recent comment about a ruling in a federal court in Hawaii that stopped President Trump ’ s executive order suspending travel from six terror-prone countries from going into effect .
Earlier Friday , Secretary Kelly told Kate Bolduan of CNN that President Barack Obama had presided over a “ very , very open border ” and that Obama had done “ nothing ” to secure the border and enforce immigration law internally .
Outside the event , about a dozen demonstrators from the Remembrance Project , which commemorates victims killed by illegal aliens , gathered to support the Trump administration ’ s efforts .
Vaught Becht of Orange County gave the administration an “ A-plus ” for its work on immigration and border security thus far .
“ I think they ’ re doing a great job . We ’ ve got a new era . [ Trump ] supports the citizens . America first , and jobs first . We ’ ve got a new sheriff in town . He speaks for the American people , not the swamp in D.C . He speaks for us . ”
