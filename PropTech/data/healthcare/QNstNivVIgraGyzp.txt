Those who signed up for ObamaCare or were forced into it now are learning they 're going to face some nasty surprises when they seek care .
`` Many consumers ended up purchasing a plan through the exchange , thinking it would cover their normal set of physicians , and hospitals , '' says Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center .
“ Now as they are using services , they are figuring out that they do n't . ''
Which is why President Obama was forced to confess he was wrong to say that people could keep their plans or their doctors , no matter what .
At a news conference last fall as plans on the individual market were being canceled by the millions , the president said , `` With respect to the pledge I made that if you like your plan you can keep it ... there is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate . ''
For instance , one study shows that while a commercial plan would have about 40 cardiologists per 100,000 people , a typical ObamaCare plan would have an average of only 15 .
Dr. Scott Gottlieb of the American Enterprise Institute , or AEI , found a similar situation in a county in Florida where there are `` seven pediatricians for a county that serviced almost a quarter of a million children . We found plans in San Diego County that only gave you access to 10 dermatologists . ''
The root of the problem is that extra benefits offered on healthcare.gov were so expensive the only thing insurers could do to hold down costs was clamp down on providers .
`` I found counties , for example , again in California , where the nearest urologist was 90 miles away , '' says AEI 's Gottlieb . `` So if you think of the range of conditions , which you might need to see a urologist , sometimes you 're not going to be able to drive 90 miles to see one . ''
Matthew Eyles of the consulting firm Avalere Health says , `` Price is paramount when you 're talking about a consumer market . The premiums are the first thing that a consumer sees , and for better or worse , many of them are making decisions based on premium rather than looking at the total cost of the plan and the provider network . ''
The end result is plans that employ a version of rationing -- either by distance or long wait times to get an appointment .
`` You 're promised a lot of benefits on paper , but when you go to try to schedule an appointment to actually get access to the services , you ca n't get that appointment , '' says Gottlieb .
“ You are going to have to drive farther , the list of specialists is much narrower , '' says Jim Capretta . `` It ’ s going to feel a lot more like a public insurance program . A lot like Medicaid in terms of the selection of physicians and hospitals . ''
But Medicaid , health care for the poor , has notoriously bad access to doctors because it pays so little -- not exactly the way ObamaCare was advertised .
