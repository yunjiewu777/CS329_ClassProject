Pope Francis has urged people not to `` yield to fear '' over coronavirus , calling on them to be `` messengers of life in a time of death '' .
The leader of the Roman Catholic Church was speaking at his Easter vigil service on Saturday evening in an almost empty St Peter 's Basilica .
Members of the world 's 1.3 billion Catholic community could follow a live stream of the service .
Lockdown measures are still in place across Italy , hard hit by the pandemic .
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte praised the Pope for his `` gesture of responsibility '' in marking Easter without a congregation .
Christians around the world are celebrating Easter , the most important festival in the Christian calendar , despite the restrictions that have left hundreds of millions confined to their homes . Many priests are conducting services in churches without congregations .
Pope Francis recalled the Biblical account of a woman finding Jesus 's tomb empty on the day Christians believe he rose from the dead .
`` Then too , there was fear about the future and all that would need to be rebuilt . A painful memory , a hope cut short . For them , as for us , it was the darkest hour , '' he said .
`` Do not be afraid , do not yield to fear : this is the message of hope . It is addressed to us today , '' he added .
His service , normally held in front of thousands of worshippers , was attended by only around a couple of dozen people . Several traditional features were also scaled back , including the baptism of converts .
On Sunday , the Pope will give his Easter Sunday address at a ceremony behind closed doors . Historically it has been given to crowds in St Peter 's Square .
