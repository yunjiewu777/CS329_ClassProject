Luther Hatfield is so pleased with his U.S. senator , Florida Republican Marco Rubio , that the oysterman wants “ 10 more just like him ” in Washington -- just not in the White House .
His pick over Rubio among prospective Republican nominees for president in 2016 ? Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul .
Rubio ’ s role as co-author of an immigration-law rewrite has cooled Hatfield and other Republicans on the Tea Party hero . A six-city , three-day tour across the state ’ s Panhandle this week for Rubio revealed an anxious base of supporters he ’ ll have to pacify before he can seek to win over primary voters in Iowa or New Hampshire in 2016 .
“ It ’ s like he went out and committed adultery on us , ” said Hatfield , 62 , his short-sleeve plaid shirt tucked into blue jeans on a muggy summer day in Apalachicola . “ He ’ s got to earn our trust again . ”
Rubio , 42 , who ’ s said he ’ ll decide next year whether to run for president , fell from first to fifth in a poll of nine potential Republican candidates in Iowa , the state that holds the first contest every four years , according to Public Policy Polling surveys taken in February and July . Paul was first in the latest poll .
His drop followed passage of the Senate ’ s immigration bill on June 27 . He has seen a similar slip in New Hampshire , according to polls taken by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center . On Aug. 2 , his support among likely voters there dropped by half and he was fifth among 12 potential Republican candidates , after coming in second to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in a February survey .
Rubio ’ s standing emphasizes a conundrum for his party : Many Republicans agree on the need to revamp U.S. immigration policy after their presidential candidate , Mitt Romney , won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2012 . As a result , reaching out to minority voters was a key recommendation of a Republican National Committee report after the election .
Still , Republican lawmakers who back a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented U.S. immigrants often risk a backlash among their supporters . South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham has drawn two 2014 primary opponents , in part because of his backing for the Senate bill .
The split has surfaced in the Capitol , where Republicans who control the U.S. House have rejected the Senate immigration bill and instead are taking a piecemeal approach . House lawmakers are preparing separate measures on the issue .
“ Some people in Iowa really believe that Rubio would be unrecoverable if he chose to mount a campaign in 2016 ” for president , said Bob Vander Plaats , chief executive officer of The Family Leader , an Iowa-based coalition . “ He has severely damaged himself ” by backing immigration , said Vander Plaats , whose group backs Republican stances opposing abortion rights and gay marriage .
Rubio , dressed in a dark suit and tie for each event in Florida this week , has a life-of-the-party quality to him as he shakes hands and laughs while moving through an audience . In Panama City , he chatted with one man about high school football . He joked with a woman that her daughter ’ s acceptance at Harvard University was a great accomplishment , though she should have attended the University of Florida , his alma mater .
He mostly avoided talking about immigration on his 330-mile ( 535 kilometer ) trek through North Florida , meeting primarily with pro-business groups . He instead focused his talks on stopping implementation of the Affordable Care Act .
In a 35-minute speech to the Rotary Club of Jacksonville on Aug. 12 , Rubio spent less than 90 seconds discussing immigration , noting that it was a “ deeply unpopular ” subject among his supporters . He didn ’ t mention it during a 25-minute speech on Aug. 13 to Bay County Republicans in Panama City .
“ Politically , it has not been a pleasant experience in the least , ” Rubio told Bay County Republicans later in response to an immigration question from the audience . “ I just can ’ t stand to see something that ’ s so broken and so wrong and not try to do something to make it better . ”
Rubio met privately with anti-tax Tea Party members and other grassroots activists where he explained his work on the immigration issue .
“ He may not get it 100 percent right , but he ’ s trying , ” said Billie Tucker , a Tea Party organizer in Jacksonville who attended one of the private meetings . “ You could hear the emotion in people ’ s voices when they asked him questions . He answered them with facts and made them feel better . ”
During a radio interview in Tallahassee on Aug. 13 , Rubio said he pushed to revamp immigration law in part because President Barack Obama might be “ tempted ” to legalize undocumented workers through an executive order if Congress doesn ’ t act .
“ We could find ourselves with all 11 million people here legally under executive order from the president , but no E- Verify , no more border security , no more border agents , none of the other reforms that we desperately need , ” Rubio said on WFLA-FM .
Obama last year ordered the federal government to exempt from deportation younger undocumented immigrants who meet certain requirements . White House spokeswoman Joanna Rosholm disputed Rubio ’ s comment and said in an e-mailed statement that the “ only solution to this problem ” is a bill from Congress .
Rubio ’ s pivot to attacking Obama ’ s health-care law , a measure that sparked the Tea Party ’ s rise during Congress ’ s August recess in 2009 , would help make him a “ well-rounded ” candidate , said Tom Rath , a Republican strategist in New Hampshire .
“ Immigration is not an enormous issue in New Hampshire , ” said Rath , an adviser to Romney ’ s presidential campaign last year . “ Obamacare -- the cost of it , the implementation of it -- has universality that really matters in an economy whose recovery is , at best , feeble . ”
Americans remain skeptical about the health-care law . Freddie Wehbe , who has 200 employees at Domino ’ s Pizza franchises in Gainesville , was among several Florida business owners who told Rubio they ’ re waiting to hire workers because of uncertainty about health-insurance costs .
Three unions that typically support Democrats , including the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , last month wrote to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , both Democrats , urging them to fix a provision that they said gives employers an incentive to employ workers for less than 30 hours a week . The Obama administration has already delayed a crucial part the law , giving businesses an extra year to provide their workers with insurance .
Still , the issue has challenges for Rubio , who has vowed to vote against budget legislation that includes any funding for the health-care law .
“ Throwing it away doesn ’ t make a whole lot of sense , ” Santa Fe Health Care Chief Executive Officer Michael Gallagher said during Rubio ’ s meeting with Gainesville Chamber of Commerce members . “ There ’ s a lot of good elements in there . ”
Gallagher , whose Gainesville-based company sells health- coverage plans and runs a retirement community , questioned the wisdom of Rubio ’ s tactic in a Democratic-controlled Senate and urged him to instead fix the law ’ s specific issues .
Chris Nwasike , a 35-year-old wealth manager in Jacksonville and former Tea Party organizer , said Rubio ’ s push to defund the health-care law could lead to a government shutdown and hurt the financial markets .
At the Bay County Republican Party fundraising dinner , 72- year-old retiree Jim Bova heckled the senator as Rubio described defunding Obama ’ s health-care law as a moral issue for the party .
“ As conservatives , what issue are we willing to draw a line in the sand on if it ’ s not this one ? ” Rubio said . “ Now look , if someone ’ s got a better idea about how to stop Obamacare I ’ m open to that . But I haven ’ t heard one yet . ”
“ Why don ’ t you guys come up with one on your own ? ” Bova shouted .
“ That ’ s not trying very hard , not in four years , ” Bova shot back .
