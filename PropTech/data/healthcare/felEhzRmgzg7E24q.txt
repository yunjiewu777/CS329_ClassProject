Why the hell did Jonathan Gruber say that ? And that ? And that ? And ( sigh ) the other thing ? Those are the questions on the minds of virtually everyone in the health care world—especially the people who worked the hardest on Obamacare . Ever since the videos started popping up , one after another , America has come to know Gruber—the MIT economist who worked closely on both Obamacare and Romneycare—as the guy who thinks voters are “ stupid. ” And the guy who thinks Obamacare was passed because of trickery . And who says , ha-ha , voters don ’ t understand economics . For a while , Fox News didn ’ t have to bother running anything else .
Now America is about to see Gruber in a new role : congressional witness . He ’ s going to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to testify before Darrell Issa ’ s committee , where he ’ ll be forced to answer a ton of questions , if he can , about all those things he said . For some Republicans , Gruber is a dream witness : All they have to do is play the videos that confirm their worst suspicions about President Barack Obama ’ s signature health care law—especially the one where Gruber boasts that “ lack of transparency [ about the law ] is a huge political advantage ” —and watch him squirm . Better yet , they can ask him about the video that presents the biggest danger of all to the White House : the one where he undermines the Obama administration ’ s case in the upcoming Supreme Court lawsuit that could bring a screeching halt to subsidies for millions of Obamacare customers .
For just about everyone else who has dealt with Gruber , though—Democrats , academics , policy wonks , and the health care reporters who used to call him regularly for catchy quotes about what the latest Obamacare development really means—the videos are just head-scratchers . He ’ s a smart guy , everyone says , and he has been a hugely successful economist who clearly knows his health care policy . So they ’ re all coming back to the same question : Why the hell would he say that ? Does he really believe it ?
The answer , according to the people who know Gruber best , is that he has always been someone who is two seconds away from putting his foot in his mouth . Yes , he has had an astonishing rise in the world of health care policy—and it ’ s completely deserved , in their view , because of his groundbreaking work on predicting the cost impact of different kinds of health care legislation . Gruber is the man who developed an economic model that could basically work like a faster Congressional Budget Office—a huge help to congressional staffers as they drafted the Affordable Care Act , as well as the Massachusetts policymakers who wrote Mitt Romney ’ s health care reform law that preceded it .
But politically savvy ? No , no , no . Gruber is a chatty , affable guy , but he ’ s also a man with no filter—and he knows it . It ’ s always when he drifts away from economics , and tries to talk about politics , that he gets into trouble , colleagues say . That ’ s where Gruber stepped on so many land mines in those videos—claiming there was a strategy to hide uncomfortable details from voters , as if he knew the political strategy and not just the economics , and that the “ stupidity of the American voter ” allowed them to get away with it .
“ This is the repetition of a pattern , ” said Harvard ’ s John McDonough , a former Ted Kennedy aide who worked on both Obamacare and the Massachusetts law . “ Whenever he would get outside of the areas he knows best , it was like he was sticking a needle into his knee or something . ”
McDonough recalls one meeting of the Massachusetts exchange board where , in the middle of an argument about how much low-income people can afford to pay for their health care—a debate where Gruber thought they could afford more than most of the other board members did— “ he told a joke that we all thought was completely tone-deaf. ” Afterwards , he says , he took Gruber aside and scolded him for the remark . Gruber ’ s response , according to McDonough : “ Every time I talk about politics , I get into trouble . ”
Most people , however , say Gruber usually isn ’ t insulting . He ’ s just blunt—to a fault . Jon Kingsdale , who served as the first executive director of the Massachusetts health insurance exchange while Gruber served on the board , puts it more diplomatically : “ He ’ s not a Washington person who carefully crafts what he says before an audience the way you would polish it if you thought it was being recorded and distributed broadly . ”
Why Did Gruber Say That ? In a series of videos that have recently surfaced , the blunt MIT professor and so-called Obamacare architect seems , inexplicably , both to undermine the law he worked so hard on and embarrass his former employer , President Obama . March 16 , 2011 : Gruber spoke at the Pioneer Institute in Boston and discussed the so-called Cadillac tax on expensive health insurance plans . “ The only way we could take it on was first by mislabeling it , calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on people when we all know it 's really a tax on people who hold those insurance plans. ” January 18 , 2012 : Gruber spoke at Noblis Inc. in Falls Church , Virginia , and indicated that Obamacare subsidies would not flow to residents of states that don¹t set up their own exchange , ­ contrary to the administration ’ s argument in a critical case heading to the Supreme Court next year . “ If you 're a state and you don¹t set up an exchange that means your citizens do n't get their tax credits . But your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill. ” October 30 , 2012 : Gruber spoke during the Honors Colloquium of the University of Rhode Island in Kingston and described how a tax on insurance coverage can hit consumers—and why . “ We just tax the insurance companies , they pass it on in higher prices that offsets the tax break we get . …It ’ s a very clever , you know , basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter. ” October 17 , 2013 : Speaking at an expert panel at the University of Pennsylvania , Gruber gave his interpretation of the behind-the-scenes strategy in crafting and passing the health care law . “ This bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes . If CBO scored the mandate as taxes , the bill dies . ... Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage . … Call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever , but basically that was really , really critical to getting the thing to pass . ”
That ’ s a huge problem for the Obama administration , though , because Gruber has now become known as an “ architect ” of Obamacare—a phrase that has been used by many news organizations , including ███ , and implies that he was in the room drafting the legislation . It ’ s not , though , precise enough . His real contribution , according to most former congressional staffers who actually drafted the legislation , was to provide the economic models to figure out what the impact of different choices would be—like what different levels of subsidies would cost , and especially what would happen to the mix of healthy and sick people if there was no individual mandate . That ’ s not nothing , though . Top Democrats are running away from Gruber now—Nancy Pelosi tried to pretend she had never heard of him , and former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius says she never met with him . But of course they all knew him ; just because he wasn ’ t an “ architect ” doesn ’ t mean his work wasn ’ t important .
What really infuriates the Obama administration and congressional Democrats at the moment , however , is what Gruber said about the central issue in the latest Obamacare lawsuit to go before the Supreme Court : whether the law actually allows subsidies for people who get their health insurance through the federal marketplace that covers 37 states , not just people who get it from state-based marketplaces . If the justices decide that it doesn ’ t—thanks to the way one section of the law is worded—it can gut most of the law .
Just about every staffer who worked on the legislation says , no , that ’ s not what we meant—of course the law allows subsidies for everyone . But that ’ s not what Gruber said . In yet another video , from January 2012 , he appears to make the exact same argument that the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court lawsuit are making : “ If you ’ re a state and you don ’ t set up an exchange , that means your citizens don ’ t get their tax credits. ” Naturally , the quote from that video is right there in the petition to the Supreme Court—which calls Gruber “ one of the Act ’ s architects ” —and it ’ s a good bet that it will come up in the oral arguments . Michael Carvin , the lead attorney in the case , sums it up : “ Gruber is Exhibit A that any English-speaking person knows what the subsidies language says . ”
Gruber , who declined to comment on the record for this article , has backed away from those remarks , telling the New Republic ’ s Jonathan Cohn that at the time of his speech—January 2012—it wasn ’ t clear that the federal exchange would even be ready in time for the start of enrollment . Gruber also apologized once , on MSNBC , but otherwise has been lying low ever since the videos surfaced , watching himself so his words don ’ t get him into trouble again . That caution will have to end Tuesday , when he ’ s expected to give an opening statement and then answer questions about his comments . After that , don ’ t expect to see him surface again for a while—unless he gets called to another hearing .
So how did Gruber become such a sought-after speaker , and a quotable source for health care reporters , in the first place ? Because , unlike many academics , Gruber is not a jargon-spouting numbers cruncher : He ’ s a good “ explainer-in-chief , ” too , always ready with a plain-English translation of some wildly complicated effect of the health care law . There were plenty of reporters who turned to him as an authority not just on health economics , but on all things Obamacare . Full disclosure : I was one of them . Whenever a new set of enrollment figures came out during the bumpy rollout , Gruber was one of the first people I would call , because he would always have a clear and reasonable take on what they meant—always from the perspective of an Obamacare supporter , but if the numbers weren ’ t spectacular , he would tell you that . And he could compare the developments to the same stage of the launch of Romneycare , which didn ’ t hurt either .
