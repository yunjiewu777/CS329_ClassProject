The House plans to vote Wednesday on legislation that would roll back the so-called “ Cadillac tax ” under the 2010 health care law known as Obamacare .
The 40 percent surcharge tax applies to certain high-cost employer health care plans ( hence the “ Cadillac tax ” nickname ) . It isn ’ t set to take effect until 2022 , and Congress has twice delayed its implementation .
The tax was envisioned as a way to help pay for the 2010 health care law . There ’ s bipartisan support in both the House and Senate for its repeal , which has been a top priority for the insurance industry and labor unions .
Still , the prospect of repeal , especially without offsets to pay for it , makes health economists shudder . The Congressional Budget Office projected in May that rolling back the excise tax would cost $ 193 billion between 2019 and 2029 . Paul Van de Water , a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , wrote this week that the cost could reach $ 1 trillion in the 2030s .
The bill will be considered under suspension of the rules , an expedited procedure that limits debate and requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass . With 359 co-sponsors , the bill is expected to easily sail through the House .
Democratic Rep. Joe Courtney of Connecticut , the bill ’ s lead sponsor , asked in May that the measure be put on the House “ consensus calendar , ” which Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to when she sought the speakership last year . That creates a path to floor votes for bills with at least 290 co-sponsors .
If the House passes it this week , it ’ s not clear whether the Senate would take up the bill . The Senate never took up legislation to roll back another tax levied under the health care law , a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices , after the House passed it last year .
