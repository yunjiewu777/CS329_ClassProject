Washington ( CNN ) - Despite the flawed rollout of HealthCare.gov , a majority of Americans still seem to have an open mind about whether Obamacare will work , and more than half of those surveyed in a new national poll believe the current problems can be solved .
A CNN/ORC International poll also indicates nearly six in 10 Americans oppose the national health care law , but some give the Affordable Care Act a thumbs down because it is n't liberal enough .
According to the survey released on Wednesday , four in 10 say they support the law , with 58 % opposed . Those figures are little changed from a CNN poll a month ago , just two weeks into the rough start up of HealthCare.gov and mostly before the controversy over insurance policy cancellations due primarily to the new health law .
But 41 % say they oppose the law because they think it 's too liberal , with 14 % saying the measure does n't go far enough . That means that 54 % either support Obamacare , or say it 's not liberal enough .
Nearly four in 10 say it 's a failure , with 53 % saying it is too soon to tell .
Will the current problems faced by Obamacare be eventually solved ?
Fifty-four percent express optimism on this question , with 45 % saying that Obamacare 's flaws will never be fixed .
Younger Americans are much less likely to express negative views of the new health care law .
`` Only 25 % of 18-to-34 year olds say that the new law is a failure , compared to more than four in 10 in any other age bracket . Seven in 10 younger Americans think the current problems faced by Obamacare will eventually be fixed . Senior citizens are split , and most people between 35 and 65 years old think that the system is permanently broken , '' said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
The poll was conducted November 18-20 for CNN by ORC International , with 843 adult Americans questioned by telephone . The survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .
