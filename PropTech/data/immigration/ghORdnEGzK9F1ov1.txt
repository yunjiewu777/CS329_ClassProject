On Friday , young immigrants who have gained legal status through the program were eager for clarity .
“ My initial reaction was , ‘ Well , what ’ s the catch ? ’ ” said Carlos Robles-Shanahan , 27 , a business consultant in Chicago who is waiting for his deferred action status to be renewed . “ It felt like it sounds too good to be true . If they gave us that , what did they take away ? ”
Born in Mexico , Mr. Robles-Shanahan and his two siblings followed their parents to the Chicago area in 2004 , when they were children . He and his brother were arrested and detained by immigration officials while traveling to Boston by train in 2010 , but were given a temporary reprieve from deportation . Joining the deferred action program two years later , he said , allowed him to obtain financial aid from his college , teach for a year through a fellowship , earn a master ’ s degree in public policy , get a white-collar job and buy a house for his mother .
“ DACA changed a ton of stuff for me and my brother , exponentially , ” he said . “ It was like a switch . ”
Mr. Robles-Shanahan recently married a United States citizen and has begun the process of applying for a green card , but fears that his ability to work and live in the country will be jeopardized if his deferred action status is not renewed .
Confirmation that the Trump administration planned to preserve the program would have given young immigrants some certainty that they could apply for deferred action or renew their status , said Rigo Rivera , 27 , who crossed the Mexican border when he was 9 to join his parents in Alpharetta , Ga . Many have been afraid to apply for fear of putting their information in the hands of federal authorities .
“ With Trump , we can expect anything . Tomorrow he can say that he wants to deport us , ” he said . “ I don ’ t know what to make of this , or what to believe . ”
