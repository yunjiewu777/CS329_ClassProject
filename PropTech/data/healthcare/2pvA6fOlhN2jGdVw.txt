Shortly after the federal Obamacare exchanges launched on October 1 , 2013 , millions of Americans received policy cancellation notices in the mail . By the end of 2013 , more than 5 million people lost their insurance as a result of Obamacare making their plans illegal under the new law .
But that was just the beginning . Although President Obama has delayed the employer mandate to 2015 , businesses are planning for the future right now .
Healthcare experts estimate nearly 80-100 million private and employer provided policies will eventually be cancelled as a result of Obamacare .
Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise Institute said that in addition to the individual cancellations , `` at least half the people on employer plans would by 2014 start losing plans as well . '' There are approximately 157 million employer health care policy holders .
Avik Roy of the Manhattan Institute added , `` the administration estimated that approximately 78 million Americans with employer sponsored insurance would lose their existing coverage due to the Affordable Care Act . ''
Last week , an analysis by the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think tank , showed the administration anticipates half to two-thirds of small businesses would have policies canceled or be compelled to send workers onto the ObamaCare exchanges . They predicted up to 100 million small and large business policies could be canceled next year .
Yesterday the Congressional Budget Office released new numbers showing Obamacare will not only kill health plans , but millions of jobs too . Apparently , if you like your healthcare plan and your job , you ca n't keep either .
In an interview with Fox News ' Bill O'Reilly before the Super Bowl on Sunday , Obama refused to admit that promising the American people they could keep their health plans under Obamacare was one of his biggest mistakes . Half of voters believe the president knowingly lied about people being able to keep their plans .
