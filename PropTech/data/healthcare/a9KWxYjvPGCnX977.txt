The matter takes on a whole new urgency , when you consider that some personality changes can be dramatic . There ’ s solid evidence that the drug L-dopa , which is used to treat Parkinson ’ s disease , increases the risk of Impulse Control Disorders ( ICDs ) – a group of problems that make it more difficult to resist temptations and urges .
Consequently , the drug can have life-ruining consequences , as some patients suddenly start taking more risks , becoming pathological gamblers , excessive shoppers , and sex pests . In 2009 , a drug with similar properties hit the headlines , after a man with Parkinson ’ s committed a £45,000 ( $ 60,000 ) ticket scam . He blamed it on his medication , claiming that it had completely changed his personality .
The association with impulsive behaviours makes sense , because L-dopa is essentially providing the brain with a dose of extra dopamine – in Parkinson ’ s disease the part of the brain that produces it is progressively destroyed – and the hormone is involved in providing us with feelings of pleasure and reward .
Experts agree that L-dopa is the most effective treatment for many of the symptoms of Parkinson ’ s disease , and it ’ s prescribed to thousands of people in the US every year . This is despite a long list of possible side effects that accompanies the medication , which explicitly mentions the risk of unusually strong urges , such as for gambling or sex .
In fact , DeRubeis , Golomb and Mischkowski are all of the opinion that the drugs they ’ re studying will continue to be used , regardless of their potential psychological side-effects . `` We are human beings , you know , '' says Mischkowski . `` We take a lot of stuff that is not necessarily always good in every circumstance . I always use the example of alcohol , because it 's also a painkiller , like paracetamol . We take it because we feel that it has a benefit for us , and it 's OK as long as you take it in the right circumstances and you do n't consume too much . `` .
But in order to minimise any undesirable effects and get the most out of the staggering quantities of medications that we all take each day , Mischkowski reiterates that we need to know more . Because at the moment , he says , how they are affecting the behaviour of individuals – and even entire societies – is largely a mystery .
