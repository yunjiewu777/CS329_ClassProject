The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is looking into why the vast majority of H & R Block customers enrolled in Obamacare are being forced to pay the IRS hundreds of dollars after filing their tax returns . More from Fox News :
Committee investigators also point to an analysis by H & R Block that found almost two-thirds of its filers receiving an ObamaCare tax credit owed the government at the end of the year . On average , those filers were required to repay more than $ 700 of their ObamaCare subsidies . The study found most customers claiming the credits were confused about the requirements .
ObamaCare offers eligible consumers government-funded tax credits to buy insurance on exchanges . The federal government sets the amount based on a recipient 's stated income , family size and whether an applicant 's job offers health coverage . Generally , the health care law offers larger subsidies to those earning less , and with larger families . If a customer finishes the year earning more than they stated on their ObamaCare insurance application , the law requires them to repay a portion of the credit .
After billions of dollars have been `` invested '' in the Obamacare sign up system , we 're still seeing years later that the system is confusing and broken .
This news comes just one month before the Supreme Court will announce whether Obamacare subsidies in states without federal exchanges are legal under the law in King v. Burwell .
The ACA ’ s statutory language seems to limit federal subsidies to people enrolled “ through an Exchange established by the State under section 1311 , ” the ACA section directing states to establish health exchanges . The statute makes no mention of subsidies for enrollees on the federal exchanges authorized under a different ACA section , 1321 . The plaintiffs in the case argue that this is no accident : Congress , they maintain , intended to encourage states to create their own exchanges by offering subsidies only to state-created exchanges .
If the Supreme Court rules Obamacare subsidies in states without federal exchanges are essentially illegal , Obamacare enrollees will no longer receive those subsidies . It is n't clear whether they will have to pay back subsidies already received under proper income requirements .
