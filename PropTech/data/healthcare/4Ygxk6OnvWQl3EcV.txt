Nearly nine out of 10 Americans now have health insurance , a sharp improvement from two years ago before Obamacare was put in place .
A poll by Gallup found that the uninsured rate among U.S adults declined to 11.9 % in the first quarter , down one percentage point from the end of last year and an improvement from the 18 % without insurance in the fall of 2013 , when the Americans were first were able to sign up for coverage at state and federal exchanges .
This is the lowest percentage of Americans without coverage since Gallup started tracking the figure in 2008 . Those without coverage was just under 15 % at that time , then remained in the range of 15 % to 18 % before it started declining sharply two years ago . The law requiring most Americans to have coverage or pay a penalty took effect at the start of 2014 .
`` An improving economy and a falling unemployment rate may also have accelerated the steep drop in the percentage of uninsured over the past year , '' said the Gallup report . `` However , the uninsured rate is significantly lower than it was in early 2008 , before the depths of the economic recession , suggesting that the recent decline is due to more than just an improving economy . ''
Those making less than $ 36,000 a year have seen the most significant rate of improvement . Though 22 % still do not have coverage , that 's down from 30.7 % at the end of 2013 .
Those 26 to 34 years old have also seen the most improvement of any age group , but again , more than 20 % still lack coverage . About 98 % of those age 65 and older have coverage , basically unchanged from two years ago , as almost all of them qualify for Medicare .
And far more minority adults still are without coverage , as about 13 % of of blacks and 30 % of Hispanics do n't have coverage . But once again , they 've seen greater improvement in their rates of coverage than have whites .
