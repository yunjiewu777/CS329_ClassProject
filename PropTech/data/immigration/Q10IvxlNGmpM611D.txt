Nearly 2,000 children were nabbed at the border traveling with their parents in late April and May , Homeland Security said Friday , laying out the contours of children who are being separated under the Trump administration ’ s new zero tolerance policy .
All told some 1,995 juveniles traveling with 1,940 parents or guardians were caught between April 19 and May 31 , the department said .
The children have become the latest flashpoint in the heated immigration debate , with Democrats and increasing Republicans on Capitol Hill saying they can ’ t stomach the separations .
Looking to push back , Homeland Security told reporters that they feel they have no choice in the matter , now that they ’ re enforcing the law more fully .
A department official also refuted a CNN report that quoted an immigration lawyer saying a mother claimed her baby was taken from her while she was nursing .
CNN didn ’ t name the mother making the allegation , and Homeland Security said they ’ ve tried to track it down and can ’ t find any evidence it happened .
“ We do not separate babies from adults , ” the official said . “ We believe that [ report ] is false . ”
The official also demanded an apology from a television host he said compared immigration authorities to Nazis , saying that was a disservice to law enforcement officers carrying out laws .
He didn ’ t name the person but a number of on-air personalities have made comparisons .
MSNBC host Joe Scarborough on Thursday said parents are being told their children are being “ taken off to the showers , ” and then separated .
“ And they never return . You know , I don ’ t have to compare that to previous regimes in other horrific countries . That conclusion actually is too obvious , ” he said .
On Friday MSNBC figures Stephanie Cutter compared the detention facilities to “ concentration camps ” and Michael Steele warned viewers that “ your kids could be next . ”
The Homeland Security official who briefed reporters said immigration officers and agents deserved better .
“ For someone sitting in a studio to go on air and call them Nazis for doing their jobs , as called for by the laws Congress passed , it ’ s really disgusting , ” the official said . “ We ’ ll be waiting for that apology . ”
