It might seem that the Trump regime didn ’ t bother to talk with anyone about their Muslim ban . After all , they didn ’ t discuss it with the people at Homeland Security who would have to enforce it . They didn ’ t share it with the State Department to see how it would affect America ’ s relationships overseas . They didn ’ t give the military a peek , so someone could determine how to prepare . And they most certainly didn ’ t get an okay from the Justice Department to be sure their proposal avoided the 1965 law against limiting immigration by nation—it doesn ’ t—or that giving special treatment to non-Muslims in a series of Muslim countries would pass Constitutional muster— errrr … no .
It might seem that the whole order was simply found under a rock , or came by translating one of the Zodiac messages , or was assembled scissors-and-tape style from Breitbart comment threads . However , as it turns out , Trump ’ s team did need help in creating an order that maintained a passing resemblance with English . They got that help by stealing Congressional staff without telling Congress .
Senior staffers on the House Judiciary Committee helped Donald Trump 's top aides draft the executive order curbing immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations , but the Republican committee chairman and party leadership were not informed , according to multiple sources involved in the process .
Trump forced the staffers to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements promising they ’ d zip their lips about their work in building the ban . During his campaign , Trump even insisted that volunteers sign NDAs . ( They ’ re his favorite semi-legal document , right after prenups . ) But the idea that Trump is not just hiding the actions of government , but literally forcing government workers to promise their work will stay hidden … that ’ s fantastic in the most “ holy shit , is that an actual coup in the White House ? ” sense of the term .
