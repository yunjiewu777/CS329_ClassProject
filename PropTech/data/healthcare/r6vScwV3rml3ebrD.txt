Polling suggests that fewer people want to repeal the law
Republicans voted more than 50 times to repeal Obamacare after it was enacted
The Affordable Care Act , aka Obamacare , might not be the Republican Party 's key to electoral victory as once thought .
Patterns are emerging that Republicans and like-minded groups are broadening their scope and not homing in on a singular anti-Obamacare message .
In March , Reince Priebus , head of the Republican National Committee , told CNN 's Candy Crowley that Obamacare is `` complete poison '' and advised Republican candidates they `` have to hit your main target which is Obamacare '' in order to win .
But in the political world , things change fast , and March is the equivalent to a millennium ago .

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell , who is in a reelection bid against surprisingly strong Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes , recently said that while he wants to repeal the law , Kentucky 's version , Kynect , is `` unconnected '' to the fate of Obamacare .
Kynect is relatively popular in Kentucky , providing insurance coverage to more than 413,000 people , but was created under the Affordable Care Act and is funded mostly through federal funds .
McConnell 's shift is subtle but meaningful . During his primary campaign against a candidate who billed himself as more conservative than McConnell , the Senate leader took a hard-line stance on getting rid of -- or repealing -- Obamacare , which has been the Republican mantra until recently .
He 's not the only one . Americans for Prosperity , which is expected to spend north of $ 100 million this election cycle backing issues that Republicans favor , has also shifted its strategy .
In the lead up to the launch of Obamacare last fall , during its disastrous rollout and in the months after , AFP had a laser-like focus on the issue , spending tens of millions of dollars in states and districts where Democrats are vulnerable .
`` We do want to make sure that Obamacare is the Number One issue in the country , '' AFP President Tim Phillips said in February .
At that time , the law had been in effect for less than two months , it was lagging behind its target enrollment pace and the effects of a bad roll out still permeated .
Phillips said Obamacare is going to be the top issue because the `` tidal wave affects are going to continue with Obamacare . ''
Furthermore , a March 15 statement on the organization 's website described itself as the `` nation 's foremost advocate for health care freedom . ''
But now , two months later , AFP has broadened its scope . Its website now features a campaign against the Export-Import Bank , which is not related to Obamacare . Also , an ad airing in Louisiana , where Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu is locked in a tight reelection race , attacks her for `` wasteful government spending . '' Missing from the ad -- the word `` Obamacare . ''
In addition , its partner group , AFP Foundation , launched an $ 850,000 ad buy in Wisconsin earlier this week that focuses on taxes and also does n't mention the O-word .
`` We 're responding to the changing environment , '' AFP spokesman Levi Russell said . `` That initial shock ( of Obamacare ) has changed a little bit , but it has n't gone away . ''
Republicans are now retooling their message , after having emerged from primary battles of who 's farther to the right they must now try to appeal to a more diverse audience that has become more accepting of the federal health care program approved in 2010 without Republican support .
The latest CNN poll from early May found that 38 % of people wanted to either replace the law or get rid of it . The results are similar to a CBS poll which found 35 % of respondents said the law needs to be repealed , which is a far better billing than the 43 % who felt the same way in November .
Elizabeth Wilner with the Cook Political Report , a nonpartisan polling group , wrote that Republicans are starting to use the word `` fix '' in their campaigning , instead of `` repeal . ''
`` Republicans have been gearing up for months ... to run against Obamacare , then it started to work , '' Michael Czin , spokesman for the Democratic National Committee said , noting that 8 million people have signed up .
Since Republicans gained control of the House in 2011 , they voted more than 50 times on a full or partial repeal of the health care law , that 's more than one vote per month , but the pace has fallen off dramatically in recent months .
That matters because in an election year , congressional business is connected to electoral politics as lawmakers want to either promote their agenda or tarnish the other party .
But Russell predicts the issue will not go away , especially as the elections approach and new premium rates are announced this fall .
`` Our role is going to be to remind folks how we got here in the first place , '' he said .
