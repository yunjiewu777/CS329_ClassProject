Trouble with the HealthCare.gov site appears to be so widespread that the Obama administration has opened the door for Americans to circumvent the site altogether .
Under a plan announced Friday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the government would allow people to deal directly with insurance companies instead of through the federally run exchange website . The move comes as the administration 's self-imposed Nov. 30 deadline for fixing the site is just days away , and officials acknowledge it may not be fully operational by then .
The pilot program announced by CMS would initially launch for residents in Ohio , Florida and Texas , and is the latest effort to give users an alternative to the troubled site .
“ This is one more way we are working to offer consumers a variety of ways to enroll in affordable coverage , ” agency spokeswomen Julie Bataille said in announcing the pilot project . “ By strengthening the multiple channels to enroll in quality , affordable coverage … we are ensuring that every American who wants it can gain access to these new coverage options . ”
Bataille said that direct enrollment has “ been there from the start. ” But the option was limited by the website problems , which have been fixed to the extent that insurance companies can now send applications to the site to assess enrollees ' eligibility for coverage and potential discounts on premiums , she said .
Though the option could help Americans frustrated by the HealthCare.gov ’ s crashes , slow response times and other problems , it is another acknowledgement that the site probably will not be working for everybody by the administration ’ s Nov. 30 deadline .
Officials originally vowed to fix the site by then . As the extent of the site 's problems became apparent , officials lowered the bar on that goal -- vowing instead to significantly improve the site by the end of the month .
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that improvements to the site are on schedule , including faster response times , and that it should be able to handle 50,000 concurrent users .
`` If there are more than 50,000 people trying to use the website , individuals can choose to receive an email from CMS when the traffic on the website has been reduced , '' he said .
Administration officials have also been encouraging Americans to submit written applications , contact call centers or visit sign-up centers to enroll for insurance .
They continue to say the site will be working smoothly by the end of the month for “ a vast majority of Americans. ” And last week , they extended the enrollment deadline from Dec. 15 to Dec. 23 to get insurance coverage starting Jan. 1 .
Americans , who are required to have insurance under the president ’ s 2010 health care law , must enroll by the end of March or face a tax penalty .
In another development , GoHealthInsurance.com announced Monday that it has become the first private insurer to integrate with the so-called Federal Data Service Hub -- - which includes IRS , citizenship and other personal information . So Americans can now use that as well to bypass the federal site and enroll in health plans under ObamaCare that kick in next year .
The company also said the process includes the capacity to calculate the subsidies .
As for the CMS announcement , Bataille said the pilot project will help improve the overall direct enrollment option because insurers and enrollees will provide federal officials with “ detailed feedback on their experience . ”
