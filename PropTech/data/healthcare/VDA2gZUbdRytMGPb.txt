The problem with ObamaCare is not that it is poorly designed or sloppily implemented . The problem is in the nature of things : The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , as it has been envisaged , is inherently impossible . To see this , forget ObamaCare for the moment . Think health care in general . Health care can be many things for many people :
It can be universal ( extended to all people ) or selective ( available to some people ) .
It can be comprehensive ( covers all conditions and cures at any age ) or rationed .
But there is one thing that a health care system can not be . It can not be everything for everyone.It can not simultaneously be 1 ) universal , 2 ) comprehensive , and 3 ) affordable.This is the impossible trinity of objectives .
If it is universal and comprehensive , it is prohibitively expensive and hence unaffordable .
The only way to make it universal and affordable is to ration services , but then the system is not comprehensive .
If it is comprehensive and affordable , it can be such only for those who can afford it , and hence not universal .
As in the Omnipotence Paradox , even God can do only what is in the nature of His ( and our ) universe and can not do what is ontologically impossible , viz. , can not make 1+1=3 . Let alone the 44th president of the United States .
Ever since Chancellor Bismarck introduced national health insurance in Germany in 1883 , nations have struggled with the above trilemma of universality , comprehensiveness , and affordability .
Many approaches have been tried : governmental and private insurance with and without the enrollment mandate and mandatory coverage of conditions , with and without subsidies and price controls , with and without governmental provision of services , and any mix thereof .
One result was the same : Every system , even if it started with the trinity of objectives , ended up with reaching two at most and none at worst .
When the system strives to be universal , via mandatory and subsidized insurance , and comprehensive , via mandatory coverage , it turns out prohibitively expensive .
Insurance is unaffordable for people not rich enough for its cost and not poor enough for subsidies . Then the system is no longer universal .
To sustain mandated coverage , insurance companies restrict choices of hospitals and doctors , remove some providers from networks , and reduce payment rates to the remainder . Facing price controls , providers drop services to patients with these policies . This rationing spiral starts at the individual insurance market and then hits the employer-insured sector .
The system is no longer comprehensive . ObamaCare is an epic experiment in trying to beat the impossible trinity . It ends up neither universal nor comprehensive nor affordable . Which is , ironically , an ersatz of what the U.S. health care system was before ObamaCare . In sum , it achieves none of the above three objectives .
The tax-funded governmental system can deliver universal and affordable health care . The government is both the single payer and a major provider of free health services.Any tax-funded system is squeezed and has to sacrifice either universality or comprehensiveness .
In the latter case , services are denied , delayed , and otherwise rationed . The system is not comprehensive . People can supplement it with private insurance and out-of-pocket payments to private providers . This is , basically , the health care system in the U.K. , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , Belgium , Sweden , and Norway . It achieves two of the three objectives .
The simplest universal and affordable system is national health insurance . The government is the dominant payer to private health care providers . Due to constraints of tax funding , it has to both ration services to patients and control prices of providers , who , in turn , ration services further .
The system can not be comprehensive and patients supplement it with private insurance and out-of-pocket payments . This is , basically , the health care system in France and in U.S. Medicare .
Health care in Italy and Japan combine this system and the above British system . In sum , they all achieve two objectives out of three .
The most rigorous universal and affordable system interlocks four mandates : enrollment , inclusion , coverage , and low premia . Individuals must purchase insurance , private companies must sell policies to everyone , they must cover all conditions , and the rates must be affordable .
Then insurers , jointly with the government , must ration services and control prices of providers who , in response , ration services further .
People supplement services with complementary insurance and out-of-pocket payments . This is , basically , the health care system in Germany , the Netherlands , and Switzerland . It is universal , affordable , and not comprehensive . In sum , it achieves two out of the three objectives .
Interestingly , in each of these countries outside the U.S. a similar pattern shows up . Expenditures of the universal sector which is affordable for everyone constitute about 70 percent of national health care expenditures .
Those of the supplemental private sector , which is comprehensive , affordable to some , and not universal ( again , two out of three ) , make up the other 30 percent . This was not anyone ’ s plan . No one coordinated this pattern across countries . It was a natural evolution .
Every system naturally evolves within the range of realistic possibilities and ends up with some trade-offs between the three objectives .
The ultimate problem with ObamaCare is that it can not be affordable for all , can not be comprehensive , and can not be universal .
Moreover , in each of these respects , it may -- and probably will -- be inferior to the previous U.S. health care system , which itself was hardly the humankind ’ s greatest achievement .
The problem with ObamaCare is not the broken promises . The problem is that it is inherently undeliverable .
ObamaCare tried to defy nature , nature pushed back , and the edifice self-destructs .
