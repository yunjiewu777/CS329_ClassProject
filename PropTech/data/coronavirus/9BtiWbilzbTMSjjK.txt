With stock markets crashing , Democratic candidates cancelling events and politicians scrambling to come up with a response , the coronavirus outbreak is casting a long shadow over US politics . But some Trump supporters say the growing crisis is largely the work of a familiar villain - the US media .
Conservative radio host and three-time congressional candidate Dan Bongino had a message for the almost 2,000 Donald Trump supporters gathered in an airport hotel convention room in the toney town of Palm Beach , Florida , on Tuesday night .
The president , he said , had made stopping the spread of the coronavirus his highest priority . He had the `` finest minds '' in the world working on it 24 hours a day , seven days a week . Vice-President Mike Pence , charged with heading the virus task force , was focused `` like I 've never seen him before in my life '' .
Despite these efforts , Bongino acknowledged , the president 's power had limits - and that the virus was `` very dangerous '' and `` highly contagious '' .
`` He 's not the Messiah , '' he said . `` He ca n't just wave a wand and make this go away . ''
That the president is not an omnipotent political deity who leaves adversaries , human and viral alike , trembling in his wake was perhaps an unusual admission in a room full of supporters decked out in Donald Trump gear , surrounded by vendors hawking Donald Trump hats , t-shirts , hot sauce and posters of a beaming Trump family that proclaimed `` God , Life , Trump '' .
Less surprising , however , was that Bongino placed the blame for the growing crisis at the feet of the mainstream media , which he said `` engaged in a pathetic disgusting pile-on '' to damage the president 's political standing by making it appear that his administration was not doing enough to combat the spread of the virus and help those infected .
`` Just when I think we 've hit a new low , they impress me again with their depravity , '' he said . `` They blast right through the damn floor , and they reside in the basement . ''
Bongino ended his remarks on an up note , however , saying the US had been through wars , revolutions , the Spanish flu and `` hippies '' - and survived .
After Bongino concluded his presentation and retired to a table to pose for photographs and give his autograph to those who paid $ 30 ( Â£23 ) in cash for a copy of his new book , people present echoed his sentiments .
`` Donald Trump is a brilliant guy , '' said Mike Huey of Palm Beach Gardens . `` He knows how to surround himself with brilliant people , and I 'm sure he 's doing every thing he can to control the situation . ''
Huey , who runs an online disaster preparation and survivalist gear company , said he has `` 100 % confidence '' that the president is doing the right thing .
Despite those efforts , Trump has n't found a way to arrest the steep drop in the stock market over the past few weeks , however . Given that the president has frequently boasted about market gains over the past three years , this reversal of fortune threatens to undermine what would have been a key selling point for his re-election campaign in the autumn .
Maggie VandenBerghe , a California filmmaker in town for an event at Trump 's nearby Mar-a-Lago club , said the president 's enemies in the press were to blame for `` the scope of the hysteria '' .
`` Maybe it 's a little conspiratorial , but I would not be surprised if the media was drumming up this hysteria in part to shake things up ahead of the election , '' she said .
`` The one thing Donald Trump has really been able to run on time and time again , regardless of how you feel about his other policies , is the economy . And if they can destroy that ahead of the election , they might have a better chance of electing a Democrat . ''
Dan Ray , who goes by the nickname `` Deplorable Dan '' , also blamed the media , as well as the left and its `` Marxist mentality '' for what he called `` the goofy virus scare '' .
Ray cited a series of statistics - including fatalities in the US from auto accidents and the seasonal flu - to suggest that American fears were overblown .
`` One hundred ten people die in America every day from car accidents , '' he said . `` Those are human beings , and they 're lives , but that does n't stop me from driving . ''
There are over 1,000 coronavirus cases nationwide as of Wednesday afternoon

As for economic and health concerns , Ray is not personally worried . He said he jams soft soap under his fingernails to keep germs at bay and has been stocking up on silver dollars and survivalist gear for years , just in case of a breakdown in civil order .
`` The stock market does n't affect people like me , '' he said . `` I have n't had a bank account since 1984 . I do n't have a credit card . If I 'm going to buy something , I 've got to have cash . ''
Recent opinion polls suggest the coronavirus sentiment at the Palm Beach event , hosted by a group that bills itself as the president 's largest independent fan club , reflect the larger views of Republicans across the US - and that America is once again sharply divided along partisan lines .
According to SurveyMonkey , 62 % of Republicans think the seriousness of coronavirus is `` generally exaggerated '' , versus only 31 % of Democrats .
A Quinnipiac poll found 63 % of Republicans were either `` not so concerned '' or `` not concerned at all '' about the virus , while for Democrats that number drops to 31 % . As for the president 's handling of the response to the virus , 87 % of Republicans approve , while 83 % of Democrats disapprove .
Dawn Rofrano of Singer Island agreed that the president was handling things `` the right way '' . Like many Americans , she said , she is carrying hand sanitiser and being careful not to touch her face , but `` for the most part I 'm not scared '' .
`` I 'm looking at the facts , '' said Rofrano , who works as a health coach at a natural medicine clinic . `` That 's what I need to do . ''
As for the economy and the political risk to the president ?
`` I 'm not worried about that , either , '' she said . `` It will come back . When you are on the side of truth , I know that it will always prevail . ''
