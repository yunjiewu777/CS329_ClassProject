President Trump again used the term `` Chinese virus '' to refer to the novel coronavirus on Wednesday , despite calls from global health officials to avoid labels associating the disease with a particular nation or ethnic group . Mr. Trump 's comments have drawn backlash and raised concerns about stigmatizing Asian-Americans .
His rhetoric gained growing attention Tuesday after he used the phrase in a tweet about supporting the airline industry as travel restrictions decimate their business . `` The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries , like Airlines and others , that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus . We will be stronger than ever before ! '' he wrote .

Scientists say the virus originated in Wuhan , China , late last year — but the World Health Organization has warned against using terms that associate diseases with certain groups of people .
Despite that , Mr. Trump again referred to the coronavirus as `` Chinese virus '' on Twitter Wednesday morning and later at a White House press conference . Asked by a reporter why he continues to use a phrase that some consider to be racist , the president defended his terminology .
`` Because it comes from China , '' Mr. Trump said . `` It 's not racist at all . It comes from China , that 's why . I want to be accurate . ''
The White House also noted that similar names for illnesses have used in the past . `` Spanish Flu . West Nile Virus . Zika . Ebola . All named for places . Before the media 's fake outrage , even CNN called it 'Chinese Coronavirus . ' Those trying to divide us must stop rooting for America to fail and give Americans real info they need to get through the crisis , '' the White House said in a tweet .

On social media , many critics condemned the president 's use of the term .
`` Our Asian-American communities — people YOU serve — are already suffering , '' New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted Tuesday . `` They do n't need you fueling more bigotry . '' The NYPD is investigating several cases of potential hate crime attacks on Asian-Americans in recent days , and Asian-Americans across the country have reported experiencing heightened discrimination , bullying and harassment .
On Twitter , Dr. Eugene Gu responded : `` I 've been deathly afraid of this exact moment where Trump turns to racism and xenophobia and calls COVID-19 the 'Chinese Virus . ' We are in deep trouble as a nation now that President of the United States makes the conscious decision to go down this dark path of hate . ''

Evangelical pastor Eugene Cho called for the president to set an example of unity instead of finger-pointing . `` Mr. President : This is not acceptable , '' he wrote . `` Calling it the 'Chinese virus ' only instigates blame , racism , and hatred against Asians — here and abroad . We need leadership that speaks clearly against racism ; Leadership that brings the nation and world together . Not further divides . ''

However , at least one TV personality came out in support of Mr. Trump 's remark Tuesday night . Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson praised the president , saying , `` How is it inaccurate to call a virus from China 'Chinese ? ''
`` Good for him , '' Carlson said . `` That was Trump at his very best . ''
President Trump is asked why he keeps calling coronavirus `` Chinese virus , '' even after documented bias incidents against Chinese-Americans Trump : `` Because it comes from China .

The president has used such rhetoric before . In his Oval Office address last week , Mr. Trump made a point of referring to it as a `` foreign virus '' that `` started in China . ''
At a congressional hearing March 10 , the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Dr. Robert Redfield , agreed when asked by Congresswoman Lois Frankel that it was `` absolutely wrong and inappropriate '' to call COVID-19 the `` Chinese coronavirus . ''
`` This painful rhetoric has consequences , '' Democratic Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley said at another hearing March 12 , calling out an unnamed Republican colleague who 'd also referred to it as the `` Chinese coronavirus . '' `` Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak , we 've seen not only the spreading of the virus but also a rapid spreading of racism and xenophobia . ''
