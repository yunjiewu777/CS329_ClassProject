U.S. District Judge John Bates , a George W. Bush appointee , said the DACA cancellation was ‘ arbitrary and capricious . ’
WASHINGTON—A third federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration ’ s decision to cancel an Obama-era program protecting young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children .
The decision , issued Tuesday evening by U.S. District Judge John Bates , a George W. Bush appointee in Washington , D.C. , is in one respect the broadest so far against the administration ’ s move to end the program , called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA .
That is because Judge Bates ’ ruling requires the government to accept new applications , as well as applications for the renewal of benefits under DACA . The previous rulings required only that the administration resume accepting renewal requests .
