Looking back on the passage of Obamacare it 's important to remember two things : zero Republicans voted for the legislation and it was forced down the throats of the American people based on dozens of lies . We were told Obamacare would help the economy , the opposite is true . Millions were told if they liked their healthcare plans , they could keep them . Four years later and people ca n't keep their health insurance plans , doctors and in some cases , their jobs thanks to Obamacare .
According to new polling from Fox News , a majority of voters do not believe knowing what we know today about the negative impacts of Obamacare that the legislation would have passed in the first place .
Over half of American voters regret that the Affordable Care Act passed , and nearly two-thirds say it never would have -- if we knew then what we know now .
Fifty-five percent of voters wish the health care law had never passed . That includes majorities of young people under age 30 ( 55 percent ) and those with annual household incomes under $ 50,000 ( 52 percent ) , as well as more than a quarter of Democrats ( 28 percent ) .
The poll also finds that by a 51-42 percent margin , people think in the long run the law will be bad for the country .
Overall , 64 percent of voters don ’ t think the law would have passed if we knew back in 2009 what we know today .
What exactly was the point of Obamacare again ? Americans , including 60 percent of independents , say the bill is n't about healthcare , but about controlling their lives .
By a 16 percentage-point margin , people think the health care law is more about the government “ controlling our lives ” ( 56 percent ) than about “ helping individual Americans get the health care they want ” ( 40 percent ) .
Most Republicans ( 80 percent ) and independents ( 60 percent ) think the health care law is about government controlling our lives . A third of Democrats agree ( 33 percent ) .
And who exactly are Americans , including Democrats , holding responsible for the Obamacare disaster ? Not Republicans .
Fully 76 percent of voters overall and 61 percent of Democrats blame the Obama administration for mismanagement of the roll-out and implementation of the new health care system .
When the bill passed , just 15 percent of the country did n't have health insurance . According to Gallup , an overwhelming majority of those uninsured are n't interested in obtaining health insurance through Obamacare . Barack Obama and the Democrats completely overhauled one-sixth of the American economy to insure a tiny fraction of people who no doubt could have been helped in other ways .
