Regrets on Obamacare ? Sebelius has very few ' I think it was not only well worth it , but a battle worth fighting . '
During the worst days of the Obamacare rollout last year , Kathleen Sebelius kept her spirits up by thinking about … Medicare .
As the Obamacare website was crashing and conservative interest groups were shining the spotlight on canceled health plans , the embattled Health and Human Services secretary flashed back to the fierce battles over the creation of Medicare in the 1960s , when the American Medical Association fought its passage and called it “ socialized medicine. ” Now , she says , when the AMA speaks out about Medicare , it ’ s when the doctors are trying to prevent their Medicare payments from being cut .
The lesson for future political leaders who might be thinking about the next ambitious social programs ? Don ’ t shy away from them because of what happened with Obamacare , says Sebelius , who resigned at the end of the first enrollment season . Political battles don ’ t last — and no matter how loud the critics of Obamacare are now , their perspective will change , even if it takes years .
“ I say go for it , ” Sebelius , now a speaker and consultant , said in an interview with ███ . “ I think change is very , very hard , and there is always a default position of , either do nothing or do something very small and get in and out of the battle as quickly as possible . ”
“ I think it was not only well worth it , but a battle worth fighting , ” Sebelius said . “ Millions and millions of people are the beneficiaries of this policy . ”
The Affordable Care Act could easily be a chilling lesson for future political leaders : Don ’ t be too ambitious in creating a new social program , keep it incremental and safe , because government can ’ t handle anything this complicated . But Sebelius says there ’ s no reason for up-and-coming lawmakers and policymakers to lower their sights , with plenty of other difficult social challenges to take on — especially long-term care , a big policy headache in itself that the health care law wasn ’ t able to solve .
Yes , she knows how bad the rollout was , and she wishes it had gone smoothly from day one . Looking back on it , she would have had better coordination between the tech teams and the policy people , and she hopes the federal government finally updates its rules so it can get better contractors . But she still insists that she and other top administration officials didn ’ t get any clear warnings from the contractors that the website wasn ’ t ready — the kind that might have given them a reason to delay it .
And even though the website disaster is what everyone remembers , Sebelius says there was a whole series of other rapid-fire implementation actions that did go well — everything from putting early consumer protection provisions in place , including the popular coverage of young adults , to changes in payment incentives and the delivery of medical care .
“ There were pieces of this puzzle being put in place along the way that were not insignificant in either money or impact , and actually got up and running in very short order , ” Sebelius said .
There are plenty of Democrats who have had second thoughts about the Affordable Care Act — about the timing of the law ’ s passage , the decision to move ahead without Republican votes , the unqualified promises that everyone could keep their health care plans , and , of course , the competence of the launch . But for all of the political agony Sebelius went through — first during the bitter congressional debates that led to its passage , then during the botched rollout — she ’ s not much for second-guessing .
Sebelius does have ideas on what would help future political leaders launch programs that represent a complicated technological undertaking . She says the contracting process needs to be overhauled so the promising start-up gurus can be tapped , not just the same old companies that get the contracts mainly because they ’ ve worked with the federal government before . And she says the technology teams need to work directly with the officials who know the policy , something that didn ’ t happen enough before the enrollment launch last year .
But unlike Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , Sebelius has no regrets about turning to health care reform right at the beginning of Barack Obama ’ s presidency . Schumer argues that the Democrats addressed the “ wrong problem ” by taking on health care reform in 2009 rather than keeping their focus on the recession . Sebelius , however , sticks to the view Obama and most Democratic leaders held at the time : If health care reform didn ’ t get done then , with a newly elected president and Democrats at the height of their power , it was never going to happen .
“ I certainly would have much preferred a very smooth rollout and robust enrollment from day one . But I also feel very good about the fact that this president was able to get a law passed that 70 years of debate prior to him , of both Republican and Democratic presidents , had failed to do , ” Sebelius said .
And unlike Joseph Califano , the former Lyndon B. Johnson adviser who has questioned the decision to move ahead without buy-in from the Republicans , Sebelius doesn ’ t think it was a mistake to launch a program on Obamacare ’ s scale once it became clear that Republicans wouldn ’ t support it . That decision set the stage for years of fights and repeal efforts that are still going on today , nearly five years after its passage — unlike Medicare , which was passed with Republican votes and became accepted by the public far more quickly .
In Sebelius ’ view , Democrats did try to get Republicans on board when the bill was being negotiated . Then-Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus tried for months , she said , and she and other administration officials visited with Republicans on the Hill many times . “ But I think at the end of the day , he knew that this was a moment in time , and if it did not happen at this moment , there was no guarantee it would ever happen , ” she said . “ And it was one of the things that he felt very strongly about , very personally about , and also had promised the American public that he would do . ”
“ You hear echoes of that debate in immigration . Would people like a bipartisan , comprehensive approach to immigration ? You bet , ” Sebelius said . But “ the only way to move forward is really executive authority right now , because there isn ’ t a bipartisan approach . ”
