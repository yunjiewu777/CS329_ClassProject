There was no sugar-coating it this time . No optimistic talk of miracle cures or Easter-time business re-openings .
There was just the cold , hard reality of the facts on the ground .
`` I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead , '' a grave-faced Donald Trump said in his Tuesday afternoon press conference .
`` This is going to be a very , very painful two weeks . ''
How painful ? When the president was asked how many Americans are currently projected to die from the virus given even the current mitigation efforts , he said it was better if his medical experts responded .
The number of deaths , based on current projections , is between 100,000 and 200,000 . On 15 April , for instance , 2,214 Americans are expected to die .
`` No-one is denying that we 're going through a very , very difficult time , '' said Dr Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . `` That 's what it is . ''
The president tried to frame this news as best he could , noting that the projections for US casualties if the government had done nothing were in the millions .
`` A lot of people were saying think of it as the flu , but it 's not the flu , '' he said . `` It 's vicious . ''
Of course , it was just a week ago the president himself was making exactly such comparisons , noting that the early fatality numbers were much less than those from the flu or even automobile accidents .
`` We lose thousands of people a year to the flu , '' he said then . `` We never turn the country off . ''
Now , however , the seriousness of the situation has hit home .
He spoke of checking in on a friend who was in the hospital with the virus - `` a little older , and he 's heavy , but he 's tough person '' - only to find out he was now in a coma .
`` I spoke to some of my friends , and they ca n't believe what they 're seeing , '' he said .
Mr Trump 's change of attitude also extended to some of his recent political feuds .
Just days after attacking Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer , mocking her name and calling her incompetent on Twitter , the president said he had a `` really great conversation '' with her and detailed the support the federal government was providing her state .
Last Friday , he had suggested that if state leaders were not `` appreciative '' of him , he would n't talk to them .
On Tuesday , he recounted conversations with Democratic governors in California and Louisiana .
There was still a veiled shot at New York and its Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo , however , as the president suggested that both his state and New Jersey - the two hardest hit in the US - `` got off to a very late start '' with their pandemic response .
Trump also pushed back against Cuomo 's complaint earlier on Tuesday that states were being forced to bid against each other , and the federal government , on the ventilator market .
`` They should n't be doing that , '' the president said . `` If that happens , they should be calling us . If they need them that badly , we know . ''
`` Some people frankly think they need them but they do n't need them , '' he added .
The new call from the White House was to continue the current mitigation efforts for an additional 30 days ; that even if things go from bad to worse in the weeks to come , the efforts will pay off .
`` There 's no magic bullet , '' said Dr Deborah Birx , one of the experts on the US taskforce .
`` There 's no magic vaccine or therapy . Just behaviours , '' she said .
