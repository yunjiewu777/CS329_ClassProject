“ I was a poster child for why folks should have this opportunity , ” Mr. Horrigan said .
Then realities set in . Because of the law , the state eliminated the high-risk pool that provided his coverage , for which he paid about $ 400 a month . Then Ms. Horrigan learned that her insurer , Blue Cross , was discontinuing her plan — which was deemed substandard under the new law — and replacing it with one that would cost $ 620 a month , up from $ 325 , with a higher deductible as well .
Now , after Mr. Obama ’ s reversal , Blue Cross says it will extend her policy , though at a higher cost : She will get a one-year rate of $ 402 , an increase of 23.6 percent , she said . After all the confusion , she will renew — and her husband has selected a midlevel plan through Blue Cross that will cost about $ 670 per month .
Calling the increases “ unreasonable , ” Ms. Horrigan acknowledged that they may be necessary to make the new system work .
“ I appreciate the irony of complaining about my premiums being increased when it protects somebody like my husband , ” she said . “ I reluctantly say we will probably be better off even though it hits us hard in the pocket . ”
Prices are rising for several reasons , including the law ’ s higher standards for coverage , and fees and taxes associated with it , said Barbara Morales Burke , vice president for health policy at Blue Cross in North Carolina . But she said the sticker shock some are feeling also has another cause : For years , insurers could charge people different prices based on factors like their health or gender . Now that the law prohibits such practices , some who benefited from the old system will be asked to pay more , while those who had been at a disadvantage will see some relief .
“ This is a disruption to the marketplace , ” she said , and estimated that about a third of Blue Cross ’ s individual insurance customers would see a significant increase in their rates .
