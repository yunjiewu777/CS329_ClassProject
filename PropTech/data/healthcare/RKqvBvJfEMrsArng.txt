Analysis from the Brookings Institution says that 15 million people could lose coverage under Speaker Paul Ryan ’ s American Health Care Act .
The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) has yet to score the Ryan plan , although the Brookings Institution ’ s report does not bode well for the House leadership ’ s bill .
The Ryan plan reports , “ We conclude that CBO ’ s analysis will likely estimate that at least 15 million people will lose coverage under the American Health Care Act ( AHCA ) by the end of the ten-year scoring window . Estimates could be higher , but it ’ s [ sic ] is unlikely they will be significantly lower . ”
The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Ryan plan ’ s tax credits aid wealthier Americans more than lower-income individuals . Older Americans would face comparatively less aid through tax credits than younger counterparts .
American Medical Association CEO James Madara also criticized the Republican leadership ’ s tax credits , saying , “ We believe credits inversely related to income , rather than age as proposed in the committee ’ s legislation , not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of tax-payer resources . ”
Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( R-TX ) has maintained that tax credits help everyone get covered . He said , “ It covers more people , because it applies to those who don ’ t have a tax liability , and it ’ s advanceable , so it ’ s available today . ”
Avik Roy , a health expert at Forbes , argued that tax credits in the Ryan plan will “ price many poor and vulnerable people out of the health insurance market . ”
Michael Cannon , the Cato Institute ’ s director of health policy studies , believes that the GOP ’ s Obamacare replacement bill will force the poor to lose their coverage . He lamented , “ If the tax credits ( read : subsidies ) for low-income Americans are less than under Obamacare , many more low-income patients will lose coverage . Premiums will continue to rise . Republicans will take the blame for all of it , because they will have failed to repeal Obamacare , or learn its lessons , when they had the chance . ”
