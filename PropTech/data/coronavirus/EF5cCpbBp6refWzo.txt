The world is facing `` a dangerous epidemic of misinformation '' about COVID-19 — and the only vaccine is to reestablish public trust , the head of the United Nations said Tuesday .
`` Around the world , people are scared . They want to know what to do and where to turn for advice , '' said U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres .
The distortion and willful ignorance of scientific facts is a `` poison that is putting even more lives at risk '' during the most challenging crisis since World War II , Guterres said .
With COVID-19 now responsible for more than 120,000 deaths and nearly 2 million cases worldwide , the U.N. is creating a special communications project to combat misinformation about the virus , the secretary general said .
`` This is a time for science and solidarity , '' Guterres said in a video message about his plan . `` Yet the global 'misinfo-demic ' is spreading . ''
`` Harmful health advice and snake-oil solutions are proliferating , '' the U.N. leader said . `` Wild conspiracy theories are infecting the Internet . Hatred is going viral , stigmatizing and vilifying people and groups . ''
Guterres called the spread of bad and self-serving information a secondary disease ; to some , it might seem more like an underlying condition of today 's media landscape . To solve the problem , he said , `` The vaccine is trust . ''
`` First , trust in science , '' Guterres said , adding , `` I salute the journalists and others fact-checking the mountain of misleading stories and social media posts . ''
The U.N. head called on social media companies to do more to root out harmful and bogus claims about COVID-19 . He also said people must be able to put their trust in institutions that are `` grounded in responsive , responsible , evidence-based governance and leadership . ''
And people must trust and respect each other even during a time of crisis , Guterres said , calling for governments to preserve human rights .
`` Together , let 's reject the lies and nonsense out there , '' he said .
