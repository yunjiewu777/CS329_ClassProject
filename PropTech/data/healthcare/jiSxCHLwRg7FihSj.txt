Democrat Doug Gansler is n't too happy about the Obamacare rollout . Obamacare fight erupts in Maryland
Maryland gubernatorial candidate Doug Gansler is incensed over the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act . He ’ s aghast at chronic problems with Maryland ’ s online enrollment platform and stunned that a state with “ literally the smartest people in the country ” would have hired a company from North Dakota , of all places , to help put its exchange in place . The whole spectacle , Gansler fumes , “ is almost like a ‘ Saturday Night Live ’ skit . ”
The punch line : Gansler , Maryland ’ s current attorney general , is a Democrat .
Washington has been locked for months in a series of partisan battles over the law known as Obamacare , as well as battles within the GOP over how best to oppose the ACA . But it ’ s the state just to the north that has served up the country ’ s first Democrat-on-Democrat brawl over the inept implementation of the law , offering perhaps a first test of Democratic voters ’ patience with the ACA ’ s technical setbacks .
In Maryland , the fight to succeed outgoing Democratic Gov . Martin O ’ Malley has pitted Gansler against state Del . Heather Mizeur and Lt. Gov . Anthony Brown , the front-runner for the Democratic nomination , who chairs the state panel on ACA implementation and has long presented himself as the O ’ Malley administration ’ s point man on Obamacare .
After vowing to make deep-blue Maryland an ACA success story , Brown — and O ’ Malley — watched with dismay as the website for the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange foundered , allowing fewer than 4,000 Marylanders to enroll in insurance plans by the end of November . The executive director of the state exchange resigned at the start of December .
Now , as O ’ Malley and his appointees have scrambled to get the state exchange back on track , Gansler has laced into Brown over the performance of the state exchange , arguing that it has “ failed miserably ” and given “ fodder for Republicans ” who want to scrap the ACA altogether . Having spent months mocking Brown as an empty suit , Gansler points to the health care mess as a case in point .
“ Brown and others were so boastful about Maryland leading the country , [ but ] here we are behind such states as Nevada and Kentucky , let alone California and states like that , ” Gansler said , emphasizing that while he is a supporter of the president and the ACA : “ I think it ’ s certainly appropriate for Democrats to question what has gone on in individual states regarding people ’ s ability to enroll in an exchange . ”
In some respects , the Maryland race is a unique one : No other state on the 2014 map features an open-seat contest for the heart of the Democratic base between two major candidates , one of whom was directly tasked with implementing a state health care exchange . For health care reform critics , Gansler is an obviously imperfect messenger , a combative politician who replaced his campaign manager last week in an effort to steady his listing bid for governor .
Even still , the success or failure of Gansler ’ s biting message could reveal just how frustrated — or how serenely patient — rank-and-file Democrats may be with the progress of a law that was supposed to cement a new era of activist government . There ’ s little chance of a competitive general election in Democratic Maryland , but success by Gansler could also presumably cheer Republicans who have put the ACA ’ s implementation woes front and center for their 2014 message .
This was never the way Gansler planned to come out swinging in the governor ’ s race . An early Barack Obama 2008 endorser who started the year as a seeming favorite to succeed O ’ Malley , his campaign suffered a string of body blows throughout the summer that have left him as an unexpected underdog to Brown .
First there was the recording that surfaced in The Washington Post , capturing Gansler dismissing Brown , who is black , for relying on his race as a campaign asset ( Gansler ’ s campaign called the recording a dirty trick ) . Then there was a Post story on accusations that Gansler ordered his state trooper detail to violate traffic laws ( a charge Gansler also chalked up to political skulduggery ) . Most embarrassing was an ABC News report featuring photos of Gansler at a raucous high school beach party featuring apparent underage drinking . ( Gansler said he was only there to tell his son what time their family would leave the area the following morning . )
Brown , meanwhile , has rolled up support from a host of unions and prominent elected officials , including O ’ Malley , Sens . Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski , Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and U.S. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer .
Even with all that weighing on his campaign , bashing Obamacare — even just on the details of implementation — is a striking turn of events for Gansler , an Obama stalwart who fought in court to uphold the constitutionality of the president ’ s signature achievement .
Asked whether his ACA attacks were merely an attempt to turn the page for his campaign , Gansler said he had “ a rough rollout because of political dirty tricks on the part of the Brown campaign , ” but called health care the real issue in the race .
Brown , a former state legislator and Iraq War veteran , declined ███ ’ s request for an interview and has in general shied away from engaging attacks from Gansler and others .
Justin Schall , Brown ’ s campaign manager , shrugged off Gansler ’ s ACA criticism as opportunistic and faulted Gansler for taking potshots on the ACA now , despite having done little to help with implementation as part of the advisory committee that Brown chairs .
“ As attorney general , Doug Gansler is a member of the Health Care Reform Council , and he hasn ’ t bothered to shown up to a meeting in the last two years , so it ’ s a little disingenuous when Doug opines on the importance of Obamacare , ” Schall said . “ When input on health care reform was needed , Gansler was nowhere to be found , and now Doug hopes people will forget his absence as he attacks a fellow Democrat on ACA . ”
