CLOSE House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rallied against the possibility of President Donald Trump declaring a national emergency . She says Republicans “ should have some dismay to the door that they are opening . '' ███
President Donald Trump plans to declare a national emergency to get more funding for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border while he signs a bill that provides some money for a physical barrier there , the White House said .
And when White House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced the decision Thursday via an image of her statement on Twitter , users noticed that it appeared to be written in Apple 's Notes app on an iPhone .
Notes , known for its textured background and sans serif font , has long been used in celebrity apologies and shopping lists , among its many other everyday applications , and some on social media noted that national emergencies can now be added to that list .
