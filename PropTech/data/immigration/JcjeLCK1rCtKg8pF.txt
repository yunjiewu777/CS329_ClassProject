A top US immigration official has revised a quote inscribed on the Statue of Liberty in defence of a new policy that denies food aid to legal migrants .
The head of Citizenship and Immigration Services tweaked the passage : `` Give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free '' .
The official added the words `` who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge '' .
He later said the poem had referred to `` people coming from Europe '' .
Ken Cuccinelli , the Trump administration 's acting head of Citizenship and Immigration Services , announced on Monday a new `` public charge '' requirement that limits legal migrants from seeking certain public benefits such as public housing or food aid , or are considered likely to do so in the future .
The new regulation , known as a `` public charge rule '' , was published in the Federal Register on Monday and will take effect on 15 October .
The rule change is intended to reinforce `` ideals of self-sufficiency '' , officials said . Critics argue that it will prevent low-income US residents from seeking help .
On Tuesday , Mr Cuccinelli was asked by NPR whether the 1883 poem titled The New Colossus at the Statue of Liberty still applied .
`` Would you also agree that Emma Lazarus 's words etched on the Statue of Liberty , 'Give me your tired , give me your poor , ' are also a part of the American ethos ? '' asked NPR 's Rachel Martin .
`` They certainly are , '' Mr Cuccinelli responded . `` Give me your tired and your poor - who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge . ''
`` That plaque was put on the Statue of Liberty at almost the same time as the first public charge [ law ] was passed - very interesting timing , '' he added .
The actual passage reads in part : `` Give me your tired , your poor , Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , The wretched refuse of your teeming shore . Send these , the homeless , tempest-tost to me , I lift my lamp beside the golden door ! ''
In the interview , he added that immigrants are welcome `` who can stand on their own two feet , be self-sufficient , pull themselves up by their bootstraps , again , as in the American tradition '' .
After the host asked if the policy `` appears to change the definition of the American dream , '' he said : `` We invite people to come here and join us as a privilege .
`` No one has a right to become an American who is n't born here as an American . ''
Mr Cuccinelli was pressed later on CNN about his comments , and pushed back on claims he was trying to re-write the poem . He insisted he was answering a question and accused people on the left of `` twisting '' his comments .
Then asked by anchor Erin Burnett about what America stands for , he said : `` Of course that poem was referring back to people coming from Europe - where they had class-based societies where people were considering wretched if they were n't in the right class . ''
The two then discussed their own immigrant ancestry , with Ms Burnett pointing out his rule would have `` excluded '' her family .
`` I 'm here because they were allowed in , and I 'm an anchor on CNN , '' she said .
Beto O'Rouke , a Democratic presidential hopeful from Texas , shared a clip from the interview and said the comments show his Trump administration `` think the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people '' .
Immigrants who are already permanent residents in the US are unlikely to be affected by the rule change .
It also does not apply to refugees and asylum applicants .
But applicants for visa extensions , green cards or US citizenship will be subject to the change .
Those who do not meet income standards or who are deemed likely to rely on benefits such as Medicaid ( government-run healthcare ) or housing vouchers in future may be blocked from entering the country .
Those already in the US could also have their applications rejected .
An estimated 22 million legal residents in the US are without citizenship , and many of these are likely to be affected .
President Trump has made immigration a central theme of his administration . This latest move is part of his government 's efforts to curb legal immigration .
The Democratic led House Homeland Security Committee condemned Mr Cuccinelli 's revision in a tweet , calling the words `` vile and un-American '' .
`` It 's clear the Trump Administration just wants to keep certain people out , '' the committee wrote , calling Mr Cuccinelli `` a xenophobic , anti-immigrant fringe figure who has no business being in government '' .
Others pointed to his background as the attorney general of Virginia , in which he led a conservative campaign against immigration and homosexuality .
Asked about Mr Cuccinelli 's remarks on Tuesday , President Trump did not directly respond to the Statue of Liberty quote , but said : `` I do n't think it 's fair to have the American taxpayer pay for people to come into the United States . ''
`` I 'm tired of seeing our taxpayer paying for people to come into the country and immediately go onto welfare and various other things .
