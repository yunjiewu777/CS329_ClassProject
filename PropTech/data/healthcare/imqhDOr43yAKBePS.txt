Obamacare ’ s third year of open enrollment began on Sunday . People hoping to sign up saw a website with fresh photos and high-tech features . They found the actual insurance of the president ’ s signature law has gotten even worse .
Unless something dramatic happens , this may be the year of the health care law ’ s collapse . Prices keep rising and service keeps fading . It should not surprise the administration that people are not signing up .
Despite all the Obama administration has done to completely upend health care in this country , there are still more than 30 million uninsured people in America today . The reason they ’ re not buying Obamacare isn ’ t because they haven ’ t heard enough about it . They ’ re not buying because it ’ s a bad deal for them .
As people log on to the government exchanges this year , they will see the telltale signs of Obamacare ’ s impending failure . These include : costs soaring , cancellations mounting , and choices disappearing .
The first thing most people will notice is the higher price tag . Premiums are jumping by double digits in many states . In Alaska , premiums will be nearly 40 percent higher next year . People buying insurance on the Minnesota exchange will pay anywhere from 14 to 49 percent more .
Premiums are just one part of the high-cost story . Many plans are raising deductibles , co-pays , and other out-of-pocket costs .
Remember when President Obama ’ s mantra was “ If you like your health care plan , you can keep it ? ” Now the administration is singing a different tune : “ If you have an Obamacare plan , you better shop around . ”
That ’ s about the only advice Washington has for people who want to avoid brutal rate increases . If you ’ re willing to switch insurance plans each year , your rates may go up by slightly less .
For some people , their old plan won ’ t be available at any price . This includes more than a half-million people insured by one of the health co-ops that have shut down in 11 states over the past few months .
It also includes people whose insurer decided it simply couldn ’ t afford to sell Obamacare coverage anymore . That ’ s what happened in my home state , Wyoming , where the company WINHealth is dropping out of the exchange entirely .
In some states , plans are changing dramatically even if the company remains . A patient may find that her longtime doctor will no longer be a part of her plan ’ s network . Maybe the hospital nearest to her home is no longer included by her insurance . These kinds of changes can leave people with very different coverage than they had before .
As people work their way around the website , they may notice that the remaining options are slimmer than ever . Analysts at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation say that more of the choices will be HMOs this time around . That can mean narrower networks and no out-of-network coverage .
In some states , the number of options is practically non-existent . According to the Kaiser Family Foundation , people living in 14 of Nevada ’ s 16 counties will have only one or two companies to pick from . In Wyoming , with the failure of WINHealth , residents will have only one option .
Insurance through Obamacare is largely coming down to a simple choice of take it or leave it . More and more Americans are leaving it .
The only people who are consistently signing up are the ones who get subsidies from Washington . For them , the website should come with a warning label reading : “ Buyer beware. ” According to the IRS , 90 percent of people who received government insurance subsidies last year got the wrong amount .
To avoid an all-out panic over low enrollment , the administration is trying to lower expectations . It ’ s lowered the bar for success to around 10 million people enrolled for 2016 . That ’ s half of the 21 million people the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says should be covered next year . It ’ s also essentially flat compared to the 9.9 million who were enrolled in June .
The administration is playing the lowered expectations game because they know how hard it is to convince more Americans to buy government-mandated insurance that costs so much . For so many people , Obamacare doesn ’ t have much to offer .
Even the $ 695 tax penalty isn ’ t enough incentive to coerce people to buy . People facing premium increases along with a $ 5,000 deductible see little reason to pay for insurance they may not want , need , or be able to afford .
Obamacare is failing because too many people want nothing to do with it . As the costs continue to rise , more people get cancellation notices , and the exchanges offer fewer choices , the collapse will only continue . We may look back at this past Sunday as the beginning of the end .
