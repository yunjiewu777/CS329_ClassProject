The U.S. ambassador to the Vatican said that during Pope Francis ’ visit to the United States next month , he expects the Pope will urge the U.S. to embrace its history of welcoming immigrants .
Ambassador Kenneth Hackett said the Pope ’ s immigration message will be important as lead GOP presidential contender Donald Trump has called for a border fence between Mexico and the United States and the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants , the Associated Press reports .
“ I think he ’ ll call us to continue to engage with it ( the world ) , don ’ t throw any walls up around our nation , don ’ t revert to isolationism , ” he said . “ We are a nation of welcoming people , so that ’ s where I think he will put his attention . ”
In addition to immigration , Hackett says Pope Francis will likely wish to discuss income inequality , family issues , and the environment while he is in the country .
AP also observes that President Barack Obama is about to fully pass the baton of “ rock-star status ” from himself to Pope Francis , who has “ embraced many of the issues Obama has sought to advance , including global warming , poverty , and diplomacy with Iran and Cuba . ”
Pope Francis has “ transcended the Roman Catholic community , ” AP states , adding that Obama has referred to him as a “ transformative leader . ”
Similarly , Vice President Joe Biden has said the pontiff ’ s visit to the United States next month will be an important event for all Americans , not only Catholics .
“ Pope Francis has breathed new life into what I believe is the central mission of our faith : Catholic social doctrine , ” Biden said in a statement . The vice president added the Pope “ has become a moral rudder for the world on some of the most important issues of our time , from inequality to climate change . ”
Pope Francis will have a brief visit at the White House during his stay in the United States . He will also visit Cuba on this trip .
“ For Obama , the visit offers a chance to imbue his remaining goals with a sense of moral authority as he approaches the end of his presidency , ” AP says .
Ironically , when Obama visited Pope Francis last year at the Vatican , his description about the meeting contradicted the official Vatican account . While Obama said he and the Pope had not discussed any social issues in detail , Vatican officials said the two leaders discussed religious freedom , life , and conscientious objection – terms often used to mean abortion and the birth control mandate in Obamacare .
A similar situation occurred in 2009 , when then-House Speaker and pro-abortion , pro-same-sex marriage Catholic Nancy Pelosi posed for a photo-op at the Vatican with Pope Benedict .
As Catholic News Agency reported at the time , the 15-minute meeting “ turned sour ” when Pope Benedict used the opportunity to reaffirm the Church ’ s teachings on the right to life and the duty to protect the unborn .
Following the meeting , the Holy See released a statement saying :
His Holiness took the opportunity to speak of the requirements of the natural moral law and the Church ’ s consistent teaching on the dignity of human life from conception to natural death which enjoin all Catholics , and especially legislators , jurists and those responsible for the common good of society , to work in co-operation with all men and women of good will in creating a just system of laws capable of protecting human life at all stages of its development .
Pelosi ’ s statement about the meeting with Pope Benedict was as follows :
