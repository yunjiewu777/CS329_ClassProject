The Homeland Security Department has granted legal status to 99.2 percent of all illegal immigrants who have applied under President Obama ’ s new non-deportation policy for young adults , according to the latest numbers released Friday .
That ’ s a slight drop from the 99.5 percent approval rate reported last month .
The policy , known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , grants legal status to most illegal immigrants under the age of 31 who came to the U.S. before age 16 — usually brought by their parents . They are allowed to remain in the U.S. without fear of deportation , and are given work permits . Most states have agreed to issue them driver ’ s licenses as well .
DACA is seen as a test-run should Congress pass a broad legalization for the 11 million illegal immigrants estimated to be in the U.S .
That ’ s one reason why the high approval rate is striking .
Critics of the Obama policy say a rate that high means the administration isn ’ t doing much screening of those who are applying .
But supporters say the high rate makes sense given the motivated pool of youngsters , known as “ Dreamers ” because of the Dream Act legislation that would give them full citizenship rights .
Estimates ranged to more than 1 million Dreamers who could apply for the new policy , though as of the end of April about 500,000 applications had been submitted in the eight and a half months DACA has been available . Of those , 291,859 have been approved while only 2,352 had been denied . The rest are still in processing
Officials say the denial rate should go higher as more applications make their way through the system . Because of potential appeals , it takes longer for a denial to be finalized than it takes to make an approval .
For example , of applications finalized in February , the agency approved 99.4 percent . But in April that rate dropped to 96.7 percent .
