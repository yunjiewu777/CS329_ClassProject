Sen. Joni Ernst , Iowa Republican , said Sunday that she wanted to see the U.S. border with Mexico remain open , but added that the “ safety of our nation comes first . ”
Her comments came in response to President Trump ’ s tweet Saturday saying that if necessary , “ we will CLOSE our Southern Border . ”
“ We would prefer that we keep it open , so let ’ s work really hard to make sure we ’ re addressing the asylum seekers before they actually come over the border , ” said Ms. Ernst on CNN ’ s “ State of the Union . ”
“ I think that ’ s the intent of the president , is to divert any issues before they actually happen , ” said Ms. Ernst . “ Of course , we don ’ t want to see the border closed , but you know what ? Safety of our nation comes first . ”
Ms. Ernst , incoming vice chairwoman of the Senate Republican Conference , said that Mr. Trump has produced results on the border issue with his tough stance .
