States want to be able to spend their federal exchange grants into 2015 . States want more time on ACA funds
States running their own Obamacare exchanges were supposed to wean themselves off federal funding by the end of this year , but some of them want that Obama administration spigot open a bit longer .
The states aren ’ t asking for the feds to dole out more money on top of the $ 4.6 billion already dedicated to exchange planning and construction . But they do want to be able to spend their federal exchange grants into 2015 as they grapple with core components of the insurance portals that are balky , unfinished or in disrepair .
The viability of state exchanges became more urgent this week after conflicting court rulings created uncertainty about whether Affordable Care Act subsidies would be available through the federal exchange — or whether the state market would be the only legal route .
A ███ survey of the 15 state-run exchanges ( including Washington , D.C. ) found that 11 are thinking about using federal dollars in 2015 — and four of those states have already applied .
Exchange officials say they need extra time to use the money because of constantly shifting technical requirements and changing demands from Washington . The expression that keeps coming up : Constructing an Obamacare exchange is like flying an airplane while building it .
In the New York State of Health Marketplace , for example , the feature that will let people automatically renew their health plan for 2015 is still under construction , said deputy director Danielle Holahan , who expects to request a funding extension around October . That ’ s partly because New York is also catching up on building tools for tasks the federal government initially planned on handling , such as approving exemptions from the individual mandate and calculating cost-sharing reductions for low-income people .
Under Obama administration guidelines , states can only keep spending federal exchange funds on essential building blocks . They can ’ t be used for salaries , offices or administrative expenses .
CMS officials referred questions about individual applications to the states , but said extending federal grants is a routine practice if they don ’ t cost more , and it ’ s hardly unique to the exchanges . States submit blueprints for how they plan to use the money . Those blueprints are reviewed and revised to ensure prudent use of taxpayer dollars .
Sometimes extensions are made for money already spent . For instance , Mila Kofman , the executive director of the District of Columbia exchange , said if the District ends up needing to seek an extension , it would likely be because the bills from vendors were late coming in .
Yet the extension for the startup funds is drawing howls from opponents . They wonder whether it ’ s simply forestalling the inevitable : a second wave of failed state exchanges forced to give up and join the federal exchange , HealthCare.gov . Several states that ran into problems in year one , like Oregon and Nevada , already have said they will migrate to HealthCare.gov .
“ The Obama administration should stop propping up state-based exchanges that have failed to gain traction with consumers , and have wasted hundreds of millions on faulty technology , ” said Josh Archambault , senior fellow at the Foundation for Government Accountability in Massachusetts , a state that may also switch to the federal portal . “ Any delay kicks the can down the road two to three years when additional state-based exchanges are likely to close their doors because they still remain unsustainable . ”
State officials , however , said that in the short-term , inadequate funding would not necessarily mean the exchanges would fall apart . Budget challenges at this point are more likely to affect outreach programs and call centers — and , by extension , hold times for prospective customers . This year , it ’ s less a question of whether the exchange itself actually works .
Still , Rhode Island , Minnesota , Hawaii and Kentucky already applied to continue spending federal dollars in 2015 . California , Connecticut and Vermont say they intend to apply . Washington state and Massachusetts are still thinking about it , depending on whether Massachusetts is still trying to salvage its exchange , rather than switch to the feds .
Colorado is the state exchange that ’ s working well and has no plans to continue spending federal funds next year ( although it ’ s not clear how much federal money it will have left ) . The Washington , D.C. , and Nevada exchanges expect to use up their grant money before the year is up ; there ’ s nothing to extend . Oregon and Maryland are shutting down their broken exchanges , so they won ’ t ask for an extension . Oregon is going federal , and Maryland is trying to adopt Connecticut ’ s technology to make its market work the second time around .
CORRECTION : Correction : An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the timing of Washington state ’ s extension request . Richard Onizuka is waiting for the exchange board ’ s 2015 budget request , not for the legislature to approve a 2015 budget .
