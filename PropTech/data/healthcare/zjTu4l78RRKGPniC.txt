The sudden collapse of nonprofit health plans supported by tens of millions of dollars in Obamacare loans is igniting a new political wildfire over the health law — and it ’ s playing out in a tight gubernatorial race in Kentucky .
The recent demise of Kentucky Health Cooperative , a nonprofit startup seeded with federal loan dollars under the Affordable Care Act , is part of a bigger , national trend . More than a third of the 23 nonprofit health plans created under Obamacare with $ 2.4 billion in federal loan dollars have collapsed , and most experts predict more failures on the horizon . Late last week , South Carolina ’ s co-op became the ninth to fail , following similar crashes in Iowa , Louisiana , Nebraska and New York .
But Kentucky is in the spotlight because the co-op went bust earlier this month amid a high-stakes political contest and it is quickly becoming a wildcard issue . The Kentucky plan dominated exchange enrollment during the first two years of operations , capturing roughly 60 percent of customers in a red state hailed as a symbol of Obamacare ’ s potential . Those Kentuckians will now have to scramble to find new coverage during the looming open-enrollment period , beginning Nov. 1 , just as voters head to the polls to pick a new governor .
`` This financial debacle is a direct result of Obamacare , ” said Republican challenger Matt Bevin , who seized on the failure earlier this month as a validation of his concerns about the landmark health care law and laid blame for it on his Democratic opponent , Attorney General Jack Conway .
“ Even though it is a disaster for Kentucky taxpayers , Jack Conway still says he would have been proud to vote for Obamacare , ” Bevin said in a statement .
Conway says the co-op 's collapse was simply the result of `` market forces , '' and argues Kentucky consumers still have more choice as a result of the health law — seven insurers to choose from this open-enrollment season , up from just three plans two years ago .
The nonprofit co-op program was devised as a way to placate liberals who were irate that the health care law didn ’ t include a government insurance option . Supporters say it was undermined from the outset , most notably when the original $ 6 billion funding was slashed by more than half . In addition , the plans were saddled with rules that prohibited them from using federal funds for marketing and restricted which customers they could go after .
“ Insurance companies did everything they could to kill co-ops in the crib , ” said former Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad , who originally proposed the co-op plan .
Republicans have seized on the failures as the result of ill-advised government meddling in the private insurance market and the latest evidence that Obamacare isn ’ t working . Last week , Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse vowed to block all appointments to HHS until the agency explains why the startups are failing .
Two days later , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blasted the co-op program on the Senate floor .
“ The administration knew beforehand that this plan was not viable and that tens of thousands of people could lose their coverage , '' the Kentucky Republican said . `` They chose to cling fast to a disastrous left-wing experiment with our health care system ... ”
Conway , meanwhile , has maintained a steady , but minuscule lead in the polls . The most recent surveys show him with leads of 5 and 2 percentage points . That means any minor change in the landscape could tilt the outcome , particularly in an off-year election where voter turnout is only expected to be around 30 percent . The Republican Governor 's Association announced on Tuesday that it will spend $ 1.6 million on ad buys backing Bevin in the final two weeks .
“ The whole business of health care in this election is so confusing to voters that Bevin might be able to use the demise of the co-op as an example of how Obamacare in Kentucky is not working , ” said Al Cross , director of the University of Kentucky ’ s Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues . “ That would be a very misleading example . ”
“ I do n't know if the Bevin campaign can capture the wind and frame the issue , ” added Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers , a Republican and Bevin backer . “ If they do , I think it will become very significant . ”
The collapse of the co-op is not the only health care issue with political salience in the Kentucky governor ’ s race . The vast majority of Kentuckians who have gained coverage under Obamacare are enrolled in public programs , with more than 500,000 individuals added to the Medicaid and CHIP rolls since 2013 .
During the Republican primary , Bevin was unequivocal about wanting to roll back Obamacare ’ s Medicaid expansion , a stance that helped him prevail in a fierce GOP primary in May . But that led Democrats to blast him for planning to abandon a half million low- and middle-income residents .
`` When it comes to health care , there is a clear contrast in this race , ” Conway said in a statement . `` Matt Bevin has pledged to kick nearly 500,000 Kentuckians off of their health care on the first day of his administration , while I want to make sure that Kentuckians continue to have access to quality and affordable health care . ”
Bevin has attempted to take a more nuanced stance in the general election . He wants the state to seek a waiver from the federal government enabling it to slash the cost of the program , while not entirely eliminating expanded coverage . But even Republicans concede Bevin has provided scant details about how he would accomplish that .
`` It ’ s unclear exactly what his answer would be , ” said Scott Lasley , a political science professor at Western Kentucky University and GOP activist . “ There ’ s a lot of folks that are concerned about how that will play out . ”
Some political observers are skeptical that health care issues , about which voters are notoriously uninformed , will ultimately prove decisive . They point out that much of the back and forth between candidates ends up as a wash in voters ' minds .
“ The regular voter has no idea who ’ s telling the truth , ” said Stephen Voss , a political science professor at the University of Kentucky . “ They can ’ t really parse out the details in the policy argument . ”
But Scott Jennings , a veteran GOP strategist in the state , argues that voters are dealing with a triple Obamacare whammy that could alter the race . The collapse of the co-op , combined with plan cancellations due to the ACA ’ s coverage requirements and average rate hikes of roughly 13 percent for 2016 exchange plans have made voters uneasy , he contends .
“ It ’ s been a roller coaster for people who aren ’ t on Medicaid , ” Jennings said .
