And even as Mr. Trump was offering reassuring words to the Dreamers — “ tell them not to worry , ” he told reporters Wednesday evening — senior White House officials were emphasizing the more hard-line features of their forthcoming immigration proposal .
In September , Mr. Trump ended the DACA program and set it to expire at the beginning of March , when recipients would no longer be able to work legally in the United States and would once again face the threat of deportation .
Democratic lawmakers and activists say they will refuse to accept any proposal that requires them to forsake the well-being of other immigrants , including the parents of the Dreamers , to secure the fate of the young immigrants themselves .
“ It is shameful that the White House is holding these youth hostage in exchange for their extreme immigration agenda , ” said Kevin Appleby , the senior director of international migration policy for the Center for Migration Studies .
On Thursday , a bipartisan group of senators calling itself the Common Sense Coalition gathered in the office of Senator Susan Collins , Republican of Maine , to discuss the immigration issue . At issue is the scope of the bill . Some senators want to draft a narrow bill that bolsters border security and codifies protections now extended to DACA recipients , which do not include a path to citizenship . Others say the legislation should take Mr. Trump up on his offer of citizenship , but to do that , lawmakers might have to take the rest of the White House ’ s deal .
“ Do we simply codify what DACA is and extend it out over a period of time , or do we try to go farther than that as the president is suggesting ? ” asked Senator Mike Rounds , Republican of South Dakota . “ If you do that , you have to address the issue of chain migration , and that ’ s where it becomes a lot more complicated . ”
