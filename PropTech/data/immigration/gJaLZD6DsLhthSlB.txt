Rubio should take the hint that this time he ’ s standing alone , the author writes . Save Rubio from himself
I don ’ t say this lightly . Those who believe in constitutionally-limited government and Judeo-Christian morality like me already lack champions as it is . We could certainly use someone as attractive and charismatic as Marco Rubio -and who also happens to not be just another older white male . That ’ s why what amounts to a political intervention is needed before we witness one of the greatest wastes of political potential in recent American history .
If you ’ re really thinking about becoming the Republican nominee for president one day , these are headlines you absolutely never want to make :
* “ Obama Plans Major Push for Gang of Eight Immigration Bill ”
* “ Secret Emails : Cato , Norquist , Rubio Use Boston Terror Attacks to Push Immigration Reform ”
* “ Pro-Immigration Reform Consultants Work Together to Craft Immigration Testimony , Attack Jim DeMint and Heritage Foundation ”
* “ They Lied to Us Then About Immigration , They are Lying Now ”
The bulk of those headlines come from Breitbart.com , RedState.com , The Daily Caller , and the Washington Examiner — four of the biggest names in national conservative media . That ’ s not even including what major thought leaders in the conservative movement are saying . They have accused Rubio ( and his staff ) of “ doing something the Democrats are salivating over , ” “ undermining the cause , ” and “ lying like Democrats . ”
Furthermore , in a recent piece for ███ , National Review ’ s Rich Lowry makes Rubio out to be little more than a rank amateur used as a de facto conservative Hispanic human shield by Democrat mastermind Chuck Schumer . That ’ s hardly the stuff of a future conservative standard-bearer prepared to take the fight to the Democrats once on the national campaign trail , let alone in the White House .
A few months ago I wrote a n open letter to Rubio warning him not to get involved with a gang of liberals and RINOs , anticipating this is what would happen . But the fallout for Rubio is actually worse than I anticipated .
Rubio ’ s staff is making it worse by violating the first rule of political messaging : do no harm . Rubio spokesman Alex Conant committed what amounts to self-immolation recently by getting into a spat with a skeptical conservative reporter via Twitter .
Conant compared the plight of those who voluntarily broke the law by coming here with those who were forcibly brought here against their will via slavery in the 18th and 19th centuries . Conant ’ s remarks , tacitly labeling those who believe we ought to pursue policies that benefit law-keepers and taxpayers whenever possible as racists , rightly created an uproar on the Right .
