From 2016 to 2017—the most recent period for which we have complete statistics—America 's death rate for cancer saw `` the largest single-year drop ever recorded . '' So says the American Cancer Society 's Cancer Facts & Figures 2020 report , which notes that the 2.2 percent drop that year was part of a larger 29 percent decline since 1991 . Back then , there were 215 cancer deaths for every 100,000 people ; by 2017 , the figure had fallen to 152 per 100,000 .
An accompanying article in CA : A Cancer Journal for Clinicians notes that this translates into an `` estimated 2.9 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred if peak rates had persisted . '' The report adds that `` the 5-year relative survival rate for all cancers combined has increased substantially since the early 1960s , from 39 % to 70 % among whites and from 27 % to 64 % among blacks . ''
For nearly three decades , the death rates for the four most common cancer types—lung , colorectal , breast , and prostate—have dropped substantially . This follows from a steep decline in smoking tobacco as well as increased early screening and improved therapies :
What about incidence rates ? They too have fallen substantially from their peaks in the 1990s , but they have flattened out in recent years :
Why the flattening ? The American Cancer Society suggests this is , in part , because of an increase in malignancies associated with rising rates of obesity , including uterine , esophageal , breast , thyroid and pancreatic cancers . `` Almost 1 in 5 cancers is caused by excess body fat , alcohol consumption , poor nutrition , and a sedentary lifestyle , '' notes the Cancer Facts & Figures 2020 report . By comparison , smoking tobacco is associated with nearly 30 percent of cancer deaths .
So there 's more to be done . But overall , this is good news : There is no rising cancer epidemic in the United States , and we 're getting a lot better at treating the cases that do occur .
