The McKinsey researchers also found that about half of the people eligible for zero-premium plans were under 39 and uninsured . The Obama administration has been emphasizing the affordability of its plans for young people , a critical group because their participation in the marketplaces will help keep overall premiums low .
It is impossible to know who will actually sign up , and whether they will choose a zero-premium plan .
For many people , paying slightly more for a silver plan may be a much better option , experts said . Ninety percent of those who will have the option of buying the no-cost plans make less than 250 percent of the federal poverty level , which is $ 28,725 for an individual , and $ 58,875 for a family of four . People earning below those thresholds are eligible for the most generous assistance , but only if they choose a silver plan .
About a million of those who will qualify for free coverage will be able to buy a silver plan for no monthly cost . McKinsey , which is releasing a report about the new insurance marketplaces , estimates that the cost of silver plans for the people who qualify for a zero-premium bronze plan will range from $ 40 to $ 50 a month .
“ They may be getting zero premiums , but they ’ re also leaving a lot of money on the table if they don ’ t enroll in a silver-level plan , ” said Sabrina Corlette , a professor at Georgetown University ’ s Health Policy Institute .
All plans , including bronze policies , limit annual out-of-pocket costs to $ 6,350 for individuals and $ 12,700 for families . But insurers and advocates said out-of-pocket costs — even those under that limit — can be daunting to people with low incomes .
For Mark and Elisabeth Horst , both artists in Albuquerque , the risks of signing up for a bronze plan were outweighed by the prospect of getting it free . The Horsts , who make $ 24,000 a year between them , qualified for $ 612 in monthly subsidies , but the cost of a bronze plan was $ 581 a month .
