The new coronavirus has been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization , as the outbreak continues to spread outside China .
`` The main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries , '' said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus .
The concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems .
Meanwhile , the US has told its citizens not to travel to China .
The state department issued a level four warning - having previously urged Americans to `` reconsider '' travel to China - and said any citizens in China `` should consider departing using commercial means '' .
China has said it will send charter plans to bring back Hubei province residents who are overseas `` as soon as possible '' .
A foreign ministry spokesman said this was because of the `` practical difficulties '' Chinese citizens have faced abroad . Hubei is where the virus emerged .
At least 213 people in the China have died from the virus , mostly in Hubei , with almost 10,000 cases nationally .
The WHO said there had been 98 cases in 18 other countries , but no deaths .
Most international cases are in people who had been to Wuhan in Hubei .
However in eight cases - in Germany , Japan , Vietnam and the United States - patients were infected by people who had travelled to China .

Speaking at a news conference in Geneva , Dr Tedros described the virus as an `` unprecedented outbreak '' that has been met with an `` unprecedented response '' .
He praised the `` extraordinary measures '' Chinese authorities had taken , and said there was no reason to limit trade or travel to China .
`` Let me be clear , this declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China , '' he said .
But various countries have taken steps to close borders or cancel flights , and companies like Google , Ikea , Starbucks and Tesla have closed their shops or stopped operations .
The US Commerce Secretary , Wilbur Ross , has said the outbreak could `` accelerate the return of jobs to North America '' .
What happens if this virus finds its way into a country that can not cope ?
Many low- and middle-income countries simply lack the tools to spot or contain it . The fear is it could spread uncontrollably and that it may go unnoticed for some time .
Remember this is a disease which emerged only last month - and yet there are already almost 10,000 confirmed cases in China .
The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa - the largest in human history - showed how easily poorer countries can be overwhelmed by such outbreaks .
And if novel coronavirus gets a significant foothold in such places , then it would be incredibly difficult to contain .
We are not at that stage yet - 99 % of cases are in China and the WHO is convinced the country can control the outbreak there .
But declaring a global emergency allows the WHO to support lower- and middle-income countries to strengthen their disease surveillance - and prepare them for cases .
The WHO declares a Public Health Emergency of International Concern when there is `` an extraordinary event which is determinedâ€¦ to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease '' .

A confirmed case in Tibet means the virus has reached every region in mainland China . According to the country 's National Health Commission , 9,692 cases have tested positive .
The central province of Hubei , where nearly all deaths have occurred , is in a state of lockdown . The province of 60 million people is home to Wuhan , the heart of the outbreak .
The city has effectively been sealed off and China has put numerous transport restrictions in place to curb the spread of the virus .
People who have been in Hubei are also being told to work from home until it is considered safe for them to return .
The virus is affecting China 's economy , the world 's second-largest , with a growing number of countries advising their citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to the country .
Voluntary evacuations of hundreds of foreign nationals from Wuhan are under way .
The UK , Australia , South Korea , Singapore and New Zealand are expected to quarantine all evacuees for two weeks to monitor them for symptoms and avoid contagion .
Australia plans to quarantine its evacuees on Christmas Island , 2,000km ( 1,200 miles ) from the mainland in a detention centre that has been used to house asylum seekers .
