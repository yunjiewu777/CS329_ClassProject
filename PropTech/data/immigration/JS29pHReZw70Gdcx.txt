Standing at the United States-Mexico border , Sen. Ted Cruz took on President Barack Obama ’ s open-border immigration policies by recounting stories of home invasion and murder that have plagued Americans , Arizona residents and border ranchers .
Cruz emphasized his position on border security and against illegal immigration ahead of Tuesday ’ s Arizona presidential primary contest . Border security has been a central focus of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump that helped launch his popularity in the early stages of his campaign .
Cruz addressed reporters from on the border in Douglas , Arizona as shown on Fox Business :
Cruz says he ’ ll listen more than talk , so border region ranchers can describe the harrowing experiences they face on a day to day basis . He recounted how the Arizonans face volumes of drug trafficking . He said one woman told a story of being monitored by a drug smuggler who figured out where she hid her house key . That smuggler has somewhat regularly used that key to enter her home “ take a shower , make a meal , wash the dishes , go to bed , sleep , get up and leave and lock the door behind him . ”
Cruz also challenged Obama that if the border is as secure as the president says it is then he should try moving the White House down to the southern border . “ The ranchers here deal every day with the threats , the threats that tragically took the life of a well-respected rancher not to far from here . Threats that challenge our basic safety and security . ”
Cruz spoke of ranchers who come across dead bodies left behind by smugglers and the negligible and nonexistent border fence . “ Far too often [ human smugglers ] abandon women or children , those who are sick , they abandon them in the desert to die . This is a national security crisis . And it ’ s a crisis that the federal government is refusing to do it ’ s job in solving. ” He described the smugglers as “ hardened , vicious , violent criminals . ”
Cruz also brought in a father who tells the story of how his young adult son was murdered by a cartel member illegal alien for no apparent reason . Steve Ronnebeck appears in a new ad supporting Cruz telling the story of his son and stating the he trusts Cruz to tear up Obama ’ s de facto amnesty executive action on immigration .
“ I trust Ted Cruz , ” Ronnebeck says in the ad , “ I trust that he ’ s going to do the things he says he ’ s going to do. ” Ronnebeck , who lost his 21-year-old son Grant in January 2015 , wrote a detailed explanation of his support for Cruz in a February article for ███ .
Cruz tweeted an image of his trip to the Arizona border with a link to his immigration plan for America :

Former Texas Gov . Rick Perry also appeared at the border press conference the day after making several Arizona stops to stump for Cruz . The Texas senator also made mention of and thanked Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels and Arizona State Representative David Gowan who were also present .
Trump has won the endorsement of two prominent Arizonans in former Gov . Jan Brewer and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio .
In recent days Cruz picked up the endorsement of Arizona Rep. David Schweikert . Rep. Trent Franks ( R-AZ ) endorsed Cruz last week .
