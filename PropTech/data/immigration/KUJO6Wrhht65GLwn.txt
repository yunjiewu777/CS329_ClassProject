Donald Trump says he will close down the US government if necessary to build his wall along the Mexico border .
The president told supporters at a `` Make America Great Again '' rally in Phoenix , Arizona , that the opposition Democrats were being `` obstructionist '' .
During the 80-minute speech , he also took aim at the media , blaming them for giving far right groups `` a platform '' .
But he selectively quoted his initial response to violence at a far-right rally that left one woman dead .
He omitted the much-criticised claim that `` many sides '' had to shoulder the blame for violence in Charlottesville , Virginia .
President Trump wants Congress to finance his controversial plan to build a `` big , beautiful '' wall along the United States ' border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants .
But Republicans will need the support of Democrats to secure funding for the wall in a government spending bill , which they are unlikely to get .
In his speech , Mr Trump said the Democrats were `` putting all of America 's safety at risk '' by opposing the wall . He said immigration officers who worked in the area said it was `` vital '' to stem the flow of illegal immigrants .
He said that , if it came to it , he would risk a government shutdown - which is what happens when legislation funding the federal government can not be passed by Congress and non-essential services stop .
`` Now the obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it , but believe me if we have to close down our government , we are building that wall , '' Mr Trump said , adding that `` the American people voted for immigration control '' .
If President Trump wants a government shutdown all he has to do is refuse to sign a funding bill sent to him by Congress .
Capitol Hill is set to debate a new budget measure this autumn , and unless it is passed federal operations will be in limbo by 1 October .
Donald Trump 's signature campaign promise - to `` build that wall '' - epitomised his appeal to the nation , an apparently simple solution to a problem freighted with racial and economic undertones .
Not only that but it would be free ! Mexico would pay , as Mr Trump and his cheering crowds repeatedly insisted .
But it turns out that governing is harder than campaigning .
Construction of prototypes near San Diego in California - which had been scheduled for this summer - has been delayed until at least December by a legal challenge from one rejected bidder .
Ranchers , environmentalists and some businesses on the border have raised objections to the plan , while one Republican congressman in Texas , Will Hurd , has even described the wall as the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border .
Mexico , needless to say , is not keen to write a cheque .
Faced with the need to win over doubters on the detail , and explain why this would be a lot of money well spent , Mr Trump has instead chosen to raise the stakes with an `` all or nothing '' approach .
President Trump attacked the media in the campaign-style speech , saying reporters had misrepresented his `` perfect '' words in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville , where Heather Heyer was killed after a car ploughed into a crowd of people protesting against far-right demonstrators including neo-Nazis .
He accused `` truly dishonest people in the media and the fake media '' of `` trying to take away our history and heritage '' because , he said , they `` do n't like our country '' .
He quoted his first public response to the violence on 12 August , which was criticised by both Republicans and Democrats for not explicitly condemning the far-right .
`` This is what I said on Saturday : 'We 're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville , Virginia , ' - this is me speaking . 'We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred , bigotry and violence . ' That 's me speaking on Saturday , right after the event , '' he said .
But his full quote was : `` We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred , bigotry and violence on many sides , on many sides . ''
Separately , the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has criticised the US for what it said was a `` failure at the highest political level '' to reject `` racist violent events '' .
Referring to Charlottesville , the committee said it was issuing a rare `` early warning '' , which has been used in recent years in countries including Burundi , Iraq , Nigeria and the Ivory Coast .
Nafta : The US , Mexico and Canada have begun talks on revising their trade deal , and negotiators are due to meet again on 1 September . But Mr Trump said he thought he would `` probably end up terminating Nafta ''

He said that Joe Arpaio - who was found guilty of criminal contempt in July over his detention of migrants - `` is going to be just fine '' , but he would not yet formally pardon him because `` I do n't want to cause any controversy ''
Responding to the speech , the former National Intelligence director James Clapper told CNN that he was questioning Donald Trump 's `` fitness '' for office .
`` I also am beginning to wonder about his motivation for it , '' he said , adding he found the rally `` downright scary and disturbing '' .
Ruben Gallego , a Democratic Party congressman in Arizona , said it was the worst-ever speech by a US president . `` It was all about him , it was not about the country , '' he told the BBC .
A former British ambassador to the US , Peter Westmacott , said he saw parallels with the establishment of Nazi Germany in 1933 .
`` President Trump did an amazing job tonight . His message is uniting our great nation ! `` , tweeted Ryan Fournier , the head of Students for Trump .
White Nationalist Richard Spencer tweeted : `` Trump has never denounced the Alt-Right . Nor will he . ''
While Mr Trump 's comments were met with cheers inside the conference centre , anti-Trump protesters who had gathered outside the rally clashed with police after the rally had finished .
A police spokesman in the city said at least four arrests were made after protesters threw bottles and rocks .
