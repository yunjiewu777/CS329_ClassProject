It says real story is all Americans can get insurance
The deal ending the shutdown may not have put a dent in Obamacare , but the battle over implementing the health coverage law is not over .
One venue that Republicans are turning to for leverage , starting next week : oversight hearings , beginning with some tough questions about why the rollout of the website for enrolling in health care exchanges is having so many problems .
`` The American people deserve to know what caused this mess , '' said Rep. Fred Upton , R-Michigan , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . `` Delays and technical failures have reached epidemic proportions . ''
Upton has already asked officials from the Department of Health and Human Services to brief his committee on the problems at a hearing scheduled for next Thursday . He also is asking them to turn over records of their communications with website contractors about the preparations for the site 's launch , and the problems people have had trying to use it .
Additionally , the chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , Rep. Darrell Issa , last week wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius demanding information about the rollout problems . Joining him was Sen. Lamar Alexander , ranking Republican on the Senate committee on health , education , labor and pensions .

One issue has been the ability to log in to healthcare.gov . A senior administration official told CNN some users , especially those who signed up `` early on , '' have been having trouble logging in , but the administration is working on a fix . There also was conflicting word on whether some passwords were deleted if they were created in the first week or so after the launch .
`` I 'll be the first to tell you that the website launch was rockier than we would have liked , '' she told an audience in Cincinnati on Wednesday , during her tour to promote Obamacare . But , she told CNN affiliate WLWT , `` There are constant improvements under way , so that we are getting people in much more quickly . ''
Nevertheless , a couple of Republicans have called on Sebelius to resign .
`` Enough is enough , '' said Sen. Pat Roberts , who has called for her to step down in spite of being a longtime friend of her family . `` Secretary Sebelius has had three and a half years to launch Obamacare , and she has failed . ''
Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana tells CNN he is working to collect signatures calling for Sebelius to leave .
`` The secretary does have the full confidence of the president , '' he told reporters . And when he was asked Thursday who would be held accountable for the problems with the website , Carney replied , `` The people who are responsible for making it work are hard at work , fixing the problems that need to be fixed . ''
He focused instead on the benefits the uninsured Americans are now entitled to .
`` The result will be millions of Americans who have insurance who did not have it before . That 's the goal . And the goal is not about the website . The goal is that the American people who have been shut out of affordable health care options in the past have those options available to them . ''
But former White House spokesman Robert Gibbs , while not naming names , said of the website on MSNBC , `` when they get it fixed , I hope they fire some people that were in charge . ''
Public attention may have been focused more on the shutdown fight this month than the problems with enrolling in the exchanges . But with the shutdown ended , part of the emerging Republican message is that the problems with the Obamacare website reflect broader problems with the law overall .
`` I think this is emblematic of how problematic this is going to be in the future , '' said Fleming . At a minimum , the implementation of the individual mandate , requiring people to get health care , should be delayed , he said .
But a spokeswoman for Sebelius said the online enrollment process is proceeding .
`` While traffic is down somewhat from its peak on day one , it remains high as Americans continue to seek to learn more about their new coverage options , '' said spokeswoman Joanne Peters .
