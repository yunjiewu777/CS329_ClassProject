Last year , the Obama administration announced to much fanfare that it cleared 8 million Obamacare enrollments but later admitted it inflated those figures by 1.3 million .
In the wake of the bogus numbers revelation , Health and Human Services ( HHS ) Secretary Sylvia Burwell apologized for the “ unacceptable mistake ” and held meetings to solicit ideas on how to repair HHS ’ s tarnished image . Moreover , Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner resigned and blamed unbuilt computer systems for the phony numbers scandal .
Now , the White House is at it again , claiming that 11.4 million people have “ signed up ” for Obamacare . Even if that number were accurate–and it ’ s not–it would still fall well short of the 13 million target the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) projected should have enrolled by now . Still , Obama ’ s latest number represents the number of people it claims have filled out paperwork , not the number who have paid their first month ’ s premium and activated coverage . The figure also includes individuals who are ineligible but filled out forms anyway–a segment of individuals that numbered in the hundreds of thousands during the last enrollment period . Indeed , even the Huffington Post was forced to concede “ the enrollment tally is bound to come down in the coming months . ”
As Forbes ’ Avik Roy notes , if the prior 84 % retention rate holds this time–and assuming HHS is not fudging its numbers again–Obamacare will “ end up with 9.5 million enrollees ” for 2015 . Again , CBO predicted Obamacare would have 13 million by year ’ s end . What ’ s more , millions of those individuals are simply the 5 million people who had their insurance plans canceled due to Obamacare and were forced into the health exchanges . Roy calculates that just 5.4 million of those signing up for Obamacare this year are previously uninsured individuals–a far cry from the 11.4 million figure Obama is touting .
Worse for Obamacare is the realization many are coming to that having an insurance card is not the same thing as having real coverage . Case in point : the New York Times ’ devastating expose revealing that complex Obamacare plans mask true out-of-pocket costs to individuals , have radically shrunk options and networks , and have left many so frustrated they have stopped seeing doctors altogether .
“ The new fees are so confusing and unsupportable that they just avoid seeing doctors , ” the Times explained .
The New York Times noted Obamacare is “ undermining its signature promise : health care that is accessible and affordable for all ” and that “ patients were paying more in health care expenses than ever before . ”
The purported purpose of the Affordable Care Act was to make insurance more affordable , not less . However , a recent CBS/New York Times poll finds that 46 % of Americans are struggling to afford health care–a 10 % jump from last year .
Obamacare remains deeply unpopular . According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls , just 39 % of Americans support Obama ’ s signature legislative achievement .
