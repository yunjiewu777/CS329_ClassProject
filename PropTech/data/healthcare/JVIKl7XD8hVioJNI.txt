Obamacare has survived a pair of Supreme Court battles and half a decade of Republican repeal efforts .
But as the Obama administration enters its final year , the Affordable Care Act is facing formidable hurdles that are largely of Democrats ' making .
By voting to delay the so-called Cadillac tax as part of a year-end budget deal , Democrats knocked out an economic pillar critical to achieving one of the act 's central goals — tamping down U.S. health care spending . President Barack Obama and the Democrats pursued that goal at great political cost . But if it falls by the wayside , Obama may have his own party to blame for his diminished legacy .
The White House ’ s defeat on that , as well as several other Obamacare taxes , comes as a series of problems have piled up since coverage expansion kicked in two years ago , from collapsing co-op health plans to double-digit premium increases . No single one of them is likely to prove fatal , but together they have significantly weakened the law that Obama spent much of his presidency fighting for .
By joining with Republicans to delay the Cadillac tax , in particular , the president ’ s party chose the short-term demands of organized labor — a key ground-game player going into an election year — over the long-term goals of Obamacare . The party offered fresh ammunition to Republicans who say the law is a money pit . And it showed a lack of political will to make Americans change their habits on health care spending .
“ Is it the death knell ? No . But it is harmful , ” said Peter Orszag , Obama ’ s Office of Management and Budget director during the drafting of the law .
The Cadillac tax was designed in part to help pay for Obamacare . But its main goal was to curb generous insurance policies that make health care virtually free to consumers , thereby encouraging its overuse and driving up spending .
While health care spending has increased at historically low levels since passage of the health care law in 2010 , there 's no consensus on whether that slowdown is primarily attributable to the Great Recession or to Obamacare . Last year , health care spending shot back up and grew by 5.3 percent , easily surpassing overall inflation . If it does n't slow down , forecasters say health spending will cripple the U.S. economy within decades .
The White House emphasizes the health care law 's successes . More than 17 million people have acquired coverage under Obamacare , and the uninsured rate is the lowest ever recorded . Competition in the fledgling Obamacare marketplaces is robust . And HealthCare.gov , after a disastrous rollout , has become a reliable vehicle for Obamacare customers to shop for coverage . More broadly , Obamacare ’ s supporters argue that multiple provisions of the law , unaffected by the Cadillac tax , are fundamentally changing the economics of health care by paying doctors for quality , not quantity , of care .
The 2016 enrollment season is off to a good start , with more than 8 million signed up , and may well exceed admittedly modest expectations .
Obama touted the law ’ s accomplishments and the signup surge before he left for his Hawaii vacation . “ The more who sign up , the stronger the system becomes . And that 's good news for every American who no longer has to worry about being just one illness or accident away from financial hardship , ” he said .
Zeke Emanuel , an oncologist who advised Obama on the health care overhaul , said Obamacare so far has been a success “ by any stretch of any metric — especially access , especially cost control , to some degree quality , the solvency of the Medicare trust fund . ”
Emanuel acknowledged , however , “ As they say in the stock brochures , past performance is no indication of future performance . ”
Indeed , the recent travails of the health care law were sizable even before the budget deal reached last week knocked out funding .
In October , the Obama administration announced it could pay only a fraction of the funds that were supposed to protect insurers competing in the exchanges from big losses — not quite 13 cents on the dollar . Republicans had blocked fuller payments . That shortfall hastened the demise of half the nonprofit co-op plans established with Obamacare loan dollars and infuriated other insurers , which are crucial to the law ’ s success . One of them , UnitedHealth Group , has threatened to leave the exchanges .
While UnitedHealth is only a minor player in most states , other big insurers are raising alarms about how sick and expensive their exchange customers are . Just this week , the trade group for the Blue Cross Blue Shield plans , which dominate many state exchanges , spelled out its concerns as it commented on proposed market regulations . “ The current risk pool is out of balance , '' the group wrote . `` A course correction is needed now or this unsustainable trend will only get worse in the future. “
Big price hikes have also been a headache for Obamacare supporters . Premiums for many plans rose by double digits for 2016 , and bigger deductibles are translating into higher out-of-pocket costs .
Unions have been plotting to junk the Cadillac tax ever since it was proposed . It 's the persistent pull of Obama 's `` if you like your plan , you can keep it '' promise : Many of them negotiated generous employer-sponsored plans in place of increased wages , and they want to keep them . So they hate the tax because it would imperil those benefits — and that ’ s the whole point of it .
Rather than pay a 40 percent excise tax on expensive policies above a certain dollar amount , employers will likely cut back , the reasoning goes . Workers will have to pay more for their own health care , so they ’ ll comparison shop and think twice before agreeing to extensive tests and procedures that they might not actually need . The whole system will have to respond by focusing on quality .
That threatened to create a lot of unhappy middle-class families over the next few years as the tax hit their benefits , too , thanks to Obamacare and the Democrats .
“ Almost everybody but health care economists was opposed to the thing , ” said former Sen. Evan Bayh , a moderate Indiana Democrat who declined to run for reelection after voting for Obamacare . “ On Capitol Hill , that ’ s a pretty hard thing to withstand . ”
It ’ s not just Democrats in Congress : Hillary Clinton came out against the Cadillac tax in September . It was just days before she won the endorsement of the National Education Association , a coup over her main rival , Sen. Bernie Sanders , who has long opposed the tax .
Congress only voted for a two-year delay — from 2018 to 2020 . But few on either side of the debate think the Cadillac tax will ever go into effect , with such a powerful bipartisan precedent for opposing it .
“ The unions and the trial lawyers have the kind of stranglehold on the Democrats that the NRA and the Chamber of Commerce have on the Republicans , ” said Steven Brill , author of “ America ’ s Bitter Pill , ” a history of the Obamacare debate .
Administration officials acknowledge privately that they weren ’ t surprised by the Cadillac tax ’ s delay , given the broad and longstanding opposition . But they remain hopeful that the two-year lapse and next round of congressional debate will give the provision a privilege that so many other parts of Obamacare have been denied : a chance to actually be refined . The original tax was a blunt instrument , and the White House is open to modifying it to make it more politically sustainable .
For now , the administration waves off the delay as having “ minimal ” impact . As White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained , three taxes were postponed in the budget deal , depriving the government of $ 35 billion , “ which sounds like a lot of money . But when you consider that during that time period — essentially over the next four years , between 2015 and 2019 — the Affordable Care Act is slated to cost $ 203 billion less than was originally projected , and that means that the net outcome here continues to be a health care policy that saves the government money . ”
The Congressional Budget Office hasn ’ t yet endorsed that perspective . Republicans never bought the idea that a trillion-dollar health care law could possibly save money . And part of the reason Obamacare has come in under budget : Not all the states took federal funds to expand Medicaid , and not as many people signed up on the Obamacare exchanges as expected , meaning the feds have to shell out less in subsidies .
Brill has argued that the law was crippled from the outset because of the political tradeoffs the drafters had to make to drugmakers , hospitals and other big health care players from coming out against it . As a result , there 's still “ a very powerful industry that has the freedom to charge whatever . ”
Others say this is just a rough patch . Supporters of the law hope this is just a transition period as insurers figure out the right types of policies for the exchanges and wait for more young , healthy people to sign up .
For big-picture backers like Emanuel , the question isn ’ t so much whether the HealthCare.gov marketplaces will survive . It ’ s whether , 30 years from now , the U.S. will still use and pay for health care the same way .
“ I ’ m worried that we will slip back into the usual mode , and the usual mode is not a good mode , ” Emanuel said . His final assessment : “ It ’ s not quite optimistic , ” he said . “ We ’ re hopeful . ”
