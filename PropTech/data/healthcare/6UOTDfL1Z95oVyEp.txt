Democrats and Obama might have to alter parts of ACA to get the GOP to budge . ACA talks : What would they discuss ?
Even if President Barack Obama and Republican and Democratic leaders suddenly started talking about Obamacare , there would be a problem : They just don ’ t have that much to talk about .
Obama says he ’ s willing to talk about his health care law , after the crisis is over . “ If you disagree with certain aspects of it , tell us what you disagree with , and let ’ s work on it , ” Obama said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon .
But the kinds of piecemeal changes that wouldn ’ t cripple Obamacare — like repealing the medical device tax — wouldn ’ t satisfy tea party Republicans . And the bigger changes Republicans have suggested , like delaying the individual mandate or the whole law , would be nonstarters for the White House .
And if the attention turned from Obamacare to entitlements and health spending , the barriers are still considerable . Yes , Obama has proposed savings to Medicare and Social Security in his own budget . But he also made it clear that those would have to be part of a package with new revenues — which Republicans aren ’ t about to give .
Here are some of the ideas that may come up if Obamacare is on the table .
Delay the individual mandate . This idea is at the heart of the Republicans ’ “ fairness ” argument : If the Obama administration could delay the requirement for large employers to cover their workers or pay fines , why shouldn ’ t regular people get a one-year break from the requirement to get health coverage or pay their own fines ?
It ’ s an argument that could have broad appeal — 22 House Democrats voted for an individual mandate delay in July . Even Jon Stewart pressed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius Monday night on why individuals couldn ’ t get the same delay as business .
The problem for the White House is the individual mandate is linked directly to the coverage of everyone with pre-existing conditions , which starts Jan. 1 . The mandate brings healthy people into the new insurance system , along with the sicker ones . That balance helps prevent the so-called insurance “ death spiral ” — rising insurance prices and fewer people covered if only sicker people enroll .
Republicans could also renew their push to delay the entire law for one year , including pre-existing condition coverage . But even if the White House was open to that delay — which it has rejected on principle — there ’ s a practical problem . People are already signing up for Obamacare health plans that start Jan. 1 . The last thing the administration needs is another P.R . nightmare — telling those people they have to wait another year .
Repeal the medical device tax . This was one of the House Republicans ’ last proposals before the shutdown , and the idea has won some Democratic support in the past . The idea is to get rid of the health care law ’ s 2.3 percent tax on the sales price of medical devices by manufacturers and importers . Striking that tax wouldn ’ t gut the basic workings of the health law , and it would relieve the pressure lawmakers from both parties are feeling from medical device makers .

The problem , though , is that a repeal of the device tax would get rid of $ 30 billion in revenue that ’ s needed to fund Obamacare . Unless it ’ s replaced with another funding source , that ’ s just another $ 30 billion added to the deficit .
And tea party groups aren ’ t likely to be satisfied with that anyway . Their point : We went through a government shutdown to get rid of Obamacare , and all we have to show for it is a medical device tax repeal ? Plus , Democrats worry that other health care sectors would start demanding rollbacks of other financing pieces of the law .
Throw Tom Harkin under the bus again . One easy concession to Republicans would be to get rid of the Prevention and Public Health Fund . The fund , authored by Sen. Tom Harkin ( D-Iowa ) , is part of the health law , but it ’ s not central to its operation and Democrats have dipped into it in the past . Republicans could welcome the repeal of what they call a “ slush fund ” — but it ’ s a “ so what ” victory to tea party members who want to wipe out the whole law .
Get rid of the Congress subsidies . Republicans like Sen. David Vitter ( R-La . ) have been flogging the issue of the subsidies members of Congress and their staffs will get to receive their health coverage through the Obamacare exchanges . They ’ re calling it a “ special break , ” and House Republicans attached a repeal of the subsidies to one of their last continuing resolution proposals — even though the real purpose is to act like the employer contributions lawmakers and their staffs have always received to get federal employees ’ health coverage .
Even if Democrats agreed to that , though , it ’ s not clear how hard Republicans like Boehner would push — since they know it ’ s a sure way to lose experienced staff members who don ’ t want to pay the entire cost of their premiums out of pockets .
