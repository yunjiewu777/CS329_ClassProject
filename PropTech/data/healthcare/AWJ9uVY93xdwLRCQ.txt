Notes from an Obama administration meeting about the problem-plagued ObamaCare website indicate only six people signed up for the health care law on its first day , according to documents released by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
███ ' Ed Henry told Megyn Kelly on “ The Kelly File ” Thursday that the documents , released by committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa , are not official enrollment numbers , but say that as of the morning of Oct. 2 , “ six enrollments have occurred so far with five different issuers . ”
The notes were taken at a “ war room ” meeting of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services , which has been tasked with implementing ObamaCare .
They say that at the next meeting , which took place on the afternoon of Oct. 2 , “ approximately 100 ” people had signed up and 248 enrollments had occurred by the morning of Oct. 3 .
The Obama administration has thus far not released any official numbers on ObamaCare enrollment , saying the first numbers would be released in mid-November after the HHS collects data from a variety of different sources .
A HHS spokesman told ███ the documents “ appear to be notes , ” and do not include official enrollment statistics .
“ As the Secretary said before Congress , we are focused on providing reliable and accurate information and we do not have that at this time due to the issues with 834 forms , ” Joanne Peters said . “ We have always anticipated that the pace of enrollment will increase throughout the enrollment period . ”
Health care industry consultant Robert Laszewski told Kelly the numbers are not surprising , saying `` clearly the White House does not want insurance companies talking about what 's going here . ''
`` And given what was released tonight , the news that so very few people are signing up , you can see why , '' he continued . `` If four weeks ago the enrollment numbers were public it would look very bad . I can tell you based upon the information that I continue to get this trickle of enrollment that you 're reporting on for the first three days has really continued for the first month . ''
The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee received the documents in response to its request to 11 of the contractors involved in the ObamaCare website rollout .
