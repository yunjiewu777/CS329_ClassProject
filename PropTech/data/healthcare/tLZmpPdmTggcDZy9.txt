A shift to a bigger , more permanent Washington-controlled health system is underway . GOP 's Obamacare fears come true
Right now , 36 states rely on HealthCare.gov , the federal exchange , to enroll people in health coverage . At least two more states are opting in next year , with a few others likely to follow . Only two states are trying to get out .
That ’ s precisely the opposite of the Affordable Care Act ’ s original intent : 50 exchanges run by 50 states .
The federal option was supposed to be a limited and temporary fallback . But a shift to a bigger , more permanent Washington-controlled system is instead underway — without preparation , funding or even public discussion about what a national exchange covering millions of Americans means for the future of U.S. health care . It ’ s coming about because intransigent Republicans shunned state exchanges , and ambitious Democrats bungled them .
Republicans had warned all along that President Barack Obama ’ s health law would lead to greater Washington control . “ This was all predictable , ” said Rep. Tom Price ( R-Ga. ) , a physician who sees growing federal control of the health system hurting patients . “ Our friends on the other side didn ’ t listen . ”
Tevi Troy , a health expert who served in the George W. Bush administration and advised Mitt Romney in 2012 , says the country needs to stop and discuss the consolidation . “ We ’ re kind of , in a way , stumbling into this situation , ” he said of the increasing reliance on the federal portal .
HealthCare.gov is more than a computerized sign-up sheet . It ’ s a marketplace , where people get health coverage through private insurers , for care from private doctors . It ’ s not a single , nationalized Canadian- or British-style program . Even within the federal model , each state has its own insurance pool and state officials still regulate health plans .
The state-exchange option gave governors and legislatures more leeway to tailor the market to suit local conditions and demands . But the states encountered political and technical obstacles , leading to investigations , recriminations , disputes with contractors and hundreds of millions of wasted dollars .
“ While [ the administration ] spent an inordinate amount of time and energy and money encouraging states to run and own their own exchanges , I think that that has kind of shifted , ” said Jon Kingsdale , a prominent consultant who helped build the original Massachusetts exchange under then-Gov . Romney . “ How long can you push a boulder uphill ? ”
HealthCare.gov was originally conceived as a just-in-case alternative that would kick in if a state could not or would not build its own health reform enrollment system . The law didn ’ t even set aside money to build the federal site , let alone operate it indefinitely . Even when red states shunned a role in running Obamacare and a handful of blue states also turned to Washington , the federal system was still seen as a short-term bridge to a state-based system .
Not anymore . After its fiasco of a start , HealthCare.gov is working . No one is pushing states with successful programs , like California and New York , to switch . But there are only a few of those . Most of the other states are in HealthCare.gov . And they ‘ re staying put rather than start their own exchange .
“ Why would any governor or legislature in their right mind step forward at this point and say maybe…that ’ s a good idea ? ” wondered John McDonough , a former aide to Sen. Ted Kennedy who worked on health reform in both Washington and Massachusetts .
In theory , states can still tap into virtually unlimited funding to create exchanges . But a number of state officials say the administration has signaled that it doesn ’ t want to keep pouring millions into broken state systems . A spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , which oversees Obamacare exchanges , said only that states should choose whatever path “ they believe best meets the needs of their consumers and insurance market . ”
“ CMS is committed to working closely with states to support efforts to ensure that all consumers will have access to quality , affordable , health coverage in 2015 , ” spokesman Aaron Albright said .
Republicans , who contributed to the growing power of HealthCare.gov by not supporting state-run exchanges , want federal investigations into why some states failed .
“ While many of these states are simply moving to the federal exchange as a convenient method of alleviating the problems with their own exchanges , it is a short-sighted solution , ” said Sen. Orrin Hatch , the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee . “ Nothing is more important right now than for Congress to find out what went wrong and why . ”
Nevada in mid-May became the latest to scrap its system and opt into HealthCare.gov . A few days earlier , Oregon had bailed on its $ 250 million exchange . Massachusetts is still trying to salvage its exchange , but it ’ s also laying the groundwork to join HealthCare.gov .
Hawaii and Minnesota both insist they are moving ahead with their underperforming exchanges ; skeptics predict they ’ ll have to jettison them and join the federal system sooner rather than later . And some small states with high-performing exchanges may have trouble keeping them over the long haul as federal financial support ends .
Connecticut ’ s exchange performed so well that Maryland wants to buy it and graft it onto its own broken one , but even the director of Connecticut ’ s exchange , Kevin Counihan , doubts that all the small states will be viable . “ There ’ s going to be some consolidation there , some going to the federal exchange , ” he predicted . “ We don ’ t need 50 of these . And having this really functional federal exchange is really very , very desirable . ”
