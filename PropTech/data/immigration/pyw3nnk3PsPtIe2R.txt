Last week the one and only hearing on the massive 800+ page long illegal immigration reform bill from the Gang of 8 was postponed due to the Boston Marathon bombing , but as things start to get back on schedule here in Washington D.C. , Obama 's Organizing for Action is asking supporters to hit the phone banks in favor of the legislation .
Last week , a bipartisan group of eight senators introduced a bill that could pave the way toward passing comprehensive immigration reform .
OFA supporters across the country are doing what they do best -- organizing to get the word out about this reform bill . We 're hosting a major Day of Action the first week of May , and we want your help in getting people to be a part of it .
This is a huge moment for President Obama and for anyone who believes we need to fix our broken immigration system . The President made it clear last year that comprehensive immigration reform is a big part of his agenda -- and we can help him keep that promise to the American people .
Even more importantly : We can literally change the lives of millions of immigrants and DREAMers -- including the 11 million people currently living in the shadows . This bill will go a long way toward securing our borders , providing a pathway to citizenship , and reducing the current backlog of applications .
And here 's the best part : It 's absolutely achievable . This is a bill that can pass the House and the Senate , but only if we 're willing to fight for it .
This will take time -- we 're not going to finish this fight today or tomorrow , that 's for sure . So we 've got to start laying the groundwork now .
Come out to the phone bank this Tuesday -- and let 's go :
Democrats in general seem to really be liking this thing . From POLITICO :
