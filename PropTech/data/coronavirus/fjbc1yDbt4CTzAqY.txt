Virginia Gov . Ralph Northam ( D ) said coronavirus restrictions in the state will remain in place through May 14 but that he will consider beginning to roll them back the following day .
“ Everything you have done has truly made a difference — we flattened the curve [ of infections ] and our hospitals have not been overwhelmed , ” Northam said in his daily press briefing Monday . “ I am keenly aware that it has come with a tremendous cost . Now we can start to move into a new phase of our response . ”
Northam on Monday announced he is extending an order closing most nonessential businesses that was set to expire May 8 , saying the positive trends need another week . A separate stay-at-home order set to end June 10 will stand . On May 15 , he said , businesses could reopen with enhanced safety measures in place . This would include customers needing to make appointments for haircuts and reduced capacity for restaurants , gyms and retailers .
After about three weeks , Northam said , institutions and businesses could begin another , slightly relaxed phase of reopening .
“ I am proud of Virginians for how you are handling this situation and for how you have stepped up to care for other people at this time , ” Northam said .
The governor said hospitals in the state have a surplus of bed capacity and a sufficient supply of personal protective equipment , and that the rate of new infections appears to have slowed . The comments contrast with those of Virginia ’ s neighbors in the capital region , including Washington , D.C. , Mayor Muriel Bowser ( D ) and Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan ( R ) , but Northam said the three remain in close communication .
“ As you know , Maryland , Washington and specifically Northern Virginia are in very densely populated areas so we do communicate , ” Northam said . “ We ’ re probably not going to do everything on the exact day but we ’ re working as close as we can . ”
