President Donald Trump on Thursday signed the spending bill and decided to declare a national emergency to obtain funding for his border wall . But not everyone is excited by the news . In fact , a number of conservative commentators and talking heads took to Twitter to explain why they 're opposed to Trump 's national emergency declaration . The most common reason people are opposed to the news : they 're afraid Democrats will utilize national emergencies in the future to push for policies they ca n't get through Congress . Remember , President Obama used a pen and a phone to get things done . And we do n't need a repeat of that .
Conservative @ mattklewis : Trump declaring a national emergency to build a wall `` is wrong ... It sets a dangerous precedent . ''
When a Democrat is President , they can `` declare a state of emergency to address a school shooting , '' or to deal with climate change https : //t.co/qpCEEONWBb pic.twitter.com/3GAIUt2xbz — CNN Newsroom ( @ CNNnewsroom ) January 31 , 2019
We will see how President Trump proceeds with this , but this makes it a whole lot easier for the next Democrat president to invoke a national emergency on guns , climate change , etc . — Lisa Boothe ( @ LisaMarieBoothe ) February 14 , 2019
This is low-key one of the greater self-owns in recent political history . He ’ s going to sign this shit bill * and * try to set a precedent that ’ ll certainly benefit Dems more than the GOP long-term . — Allahpundit ( @ allahpundit ) February 14 , 2019
Exactly why a national emergency is not a wise move . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? https : //t.co/u93AoYPyrg — Liz Wheeler ( @ Liz_Wheeler ) February 14 , 2019
I don ’ t want this national emergency move to become the new Harry Reid ’ s filibuster reform . — Dana Loesch ( @ DLoesch ) February 14 , 2019
What if Democrats one day decide to say that climate change is a national emergency ( they already have ) but have the power to use executive action ? Must be very , very careful here . — Dana Loesch ( @ DLoesch ) February 14 , 2019
Emergency declaration is a dangerous , rash , reckless , and myopic decision that should be passionately opposed by all principled conservatives . https : //t.co/UgZ7hfvR24 — Philip Klein ( @ philipaklein ) February 14 , 2019
If Trump succeeds , it would not be difficult for a Democrat to declare an emergency based on the National Climate Assessment , and then go about using the military for massive infrastructure projects in clean energy . https : //t.co/UgZ7hfvR24 — Philip Klein ( @ philipaklein ) February 14 , 2019
The only hope for limited government conservatives is that any emergency declaration gets quickly enjoined , and eventually nixed , in federal court . At least that would set legal limits on use of emergency powers . https : //t.co/UgZ7hfvR24 — Philip Klein ( @ philipaklein ) February 14 , 2019
Republican strategist Rick Wilson went on a tangent about Trump 's decision and reminded conservatives that this decision is bad for the conservative movement .
1/ Every one of you `` conservatives '' gushing about the abuse of emergency powers owns it when a Democratic President declares a national emergency on Day 1 .
Whether it 's on guns or abortion or climate or LGBT issues , you just remember , you wanted this to be how things go . — Rick Wilson ( @ TheRickWilson ) February 14 , 2019
2/ That 's just the political side , but you 'll own it . You wanted a national emergency for a totally made-up crisis , and so you 'll get more .
No tool goes unused in politics . — Rick Wilson ( @ TheRickWilson ) February 14 , 2019
3/ This declaration is social engineering to make the lumpentariat of Trump supporters feel good about how he 's going to Stop The Brown Tide and for short-term political spank-bank material for Sean Hannity and his imitators . — Rick Wilson ( @ TheRickWilson ) February 14 , 2019
4/ * Conservatives * used to be cautious about executive overreach , at least on paper .
Now , they 're cheering for a false flag emergency that will have long-running knock-on effects in the hands of the other team . — Rick Wilson ( @ TheRickWilson ) February 14 , 2019
5/ `` Conservatives '' now want to make the budget process of appropriations * enshrined in the Constitution * subject to Presidential whim alone .
From “ No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law '' to ¯\_ ( ? ) _/¯ — Rick Wilson ( @ TheRickWilson ) February 14 , 2019
The question is n't if Democrats will now utilize this strategy and point to Trump 's precedent it 's a matter of when and for what issues .
