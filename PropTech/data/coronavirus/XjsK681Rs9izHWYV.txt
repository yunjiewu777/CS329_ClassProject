Nearly 3 million Americans file for unemployment , bringing total to over 36 million Unemployment in the U.S. is at the highest rate since the Great Depression .
A total of 2,981,000 more Americans filed for unemployment insurance last week , bringing the total number of jobless claims filed amid the coronavirus pandemic to more than 36 million , according to the Department of Labor .
Since late March , millions of Americans have lost their jobs as states shuttered their economies to stop the virus 's spread . New unemployment filings peaked at a staggering 6.9 million in the week ending March 28 . Weekly unemployment filings still remain in the millions even as the number of Americans filing has been slowly decreasing .
To put into context , the previous record for new weekly unemployment filings was 695,000 in 1982 .
`` Although the initial deluge of unemployment claims is slowing , the labor market likely has further to fall as states chip away at backlogged claims , and employers navigate reopening amid a continued health crisis , '' Daniel Zhao , the senior economist at jobs site Glassdoor , said in a statement Thursday . `` We â€™ re not out of the woods yet . ''
Zhao added that Thursday 's new figure `` shows that now over one in 10 Americans have filed for UI claims over the last eight weeks . ''
The COVID-19 crisis has pushed the unemployment rate in the U.S. to a staggering 14.7 % , the highest since the Great Depression , according to data released last Friday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . Prior to the pandemic , the unemployment rate in the U.S. was 3.5 % .
