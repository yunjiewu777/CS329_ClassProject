The last remaining county to lack an insurer under the Affordable Care Act is now covered , meaning there 's not even a whisper of a death spiral in the Obamacare markets . Take that Paul Ryan and Donald Trump . The 334 enrollees in Trump-voting Paulding County , Ohio , will now have to be able to get coverage from CareSource .
They 'll only have one insurance company to choose from , and that 's not at all ideal , but it 's better than the alternative and it means that Obamacare experiment continues to work .
So while Obamacare still has a monopoly problem—there are 1,340 counties , with 2.7 million customers , where only one insurer is available—its market has n't imploded . Instead , the design of the law itself seems to have helped bring it back from the edge . State officials also worked at the local level to provide coverage for their constituents . `` It shows how resilient the market is . The open-ended premium subsidies are an enormous carrot for insurers to go into underserved areas , even in the face of significant uncertainty , '' Larry Levitt , senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation , told me . `` It 's not a great outcome to have monopoly insurers , but it 's a whole lot better than having no insurers . ''
The resilience of the law really is remarkable , surviving an all-out assault from Republicans that began when it was just a legislative idea back in 2009 , countless repeal votes , court challenges , a damaging Supreme Court decision , market fluctuations , and Trump . Nevertheless , it has persisted . Maybe it 's because the fundamental idea of making relatively affordable insurance to everyone is good . The fight is by no means over—the Trump administration is going to do its level best to destroy it , and Trump himself will not stop agitating for repeal . But it looks like getting rid of it is going to be a much heavier lift than anyone anticipated .
