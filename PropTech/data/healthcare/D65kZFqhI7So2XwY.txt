Washington ( CNN ) – Sen. Ted Cruz on Tuesday forcefully argued that Obamacare is not here to stay and pledged that he would continue working to dismantle the health care law in 2014 and 2016 .
“ I think those elections should be about many , many things , ” the Texas Republican said , listing jobs and growth as examples . “ But they should be about repealing every bloody word of Obamacare . ”
His remarks came in an address at a Washington conference hosted by the conservative group , Young America 's Foundation .
Cruz was a key player in last year ’ s fight against the law and pushed his colleagues in Congress to try to defund Obamacare ahead of a looming spending deadline . The debate between Republicans and Democrats on the issue eventually resulted in a 16-day government shutdown .
Obamacare continued to roll out on January 1 of this year , despite some major hiccups with its website and some of its key provisions being delayed .
Cruz , who ’ s considering a presidential campaign , said the opposition he helped lead last year set in motion an effort that will eventually bring the law down .
“ Some battles you can win with one clean rifle shot ; other battles take time , take building that foundation , ” he said . “ I ’ m convinced that fight has laid the foundation . ”
A CNN/ORC International Poll released last week indicated that more than half the public believes Obamacare has helped either their families or others across the country , although less than one in five Americans say they have personally benefited from the Affordable Care Act .
Cruz stressed that he ’ s “ working very , very hard to win Senate seats and retire Harry Reid . ”
He told the audience that it ’ s also up to the public to express their discontent with the law .
“ If we ’ re going to repeal Obamacare and I ’ m convinced we ’ re going to…it ’ s going to come from the people saying ‘ this thing isn ’ t working ’ , ” he said .
