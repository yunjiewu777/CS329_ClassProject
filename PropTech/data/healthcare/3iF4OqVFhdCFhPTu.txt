( CNN ) In the budget that President Donald Trump is expected to release Tuesday , CNN has reported that there will be $ 800 billion in cuts to Medicaid , which assumes that the reductions contained in the House health care bill become law . With all of the frenzied coverage of President Trump 's trip overseas and the ongoing investigation into `` Russiagate , '' one of the biggest stories of the day might have slipped under the radar .
But now it 's lighting up on Twitter . The reason : the proposed cuts to Medicaid would be devastating to low-income adults and their children , as well as the disabled and elderly Americans who depend on these benefits to survive .
Indeed , if some voters believed that President Trump might start moderating his tone or moving closer to the political center , this budget should throw some cold water on those kinds of predictions .
And the proposal could have deep ramifications for the political strength of the Republican Party .
Since its enactment in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson 's Great Society , a sweeping program of domestic reforms , Medicaid has emerged as a centerpiece of the US social safety net . Although the program started as a small and insignificant complement to Medicare , over the decades it has grown in terms of the types of benefits provided and the number of Americans covered .
