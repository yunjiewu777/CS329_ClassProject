Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton will call for a full path to citizenship for illegal immigrants at an event Tuesday in Nevada , as she goes all-in on the issue in pursuit of Hispanic votes .
Mrs. Clinton is expected to say in her remarks that a “ true solution ” to the country ’ s immigration problems would include “ nothing less than a full and equal path to citizenship , ” according to a campaign advisory provided to Reuters .
She will stress during a stop at a Las Vegas high school that any proposal that stops short of opening a route to citizenship is “ merely a ‘ second-class ’ status , ” said the advisory .
The path to citizenship for illegal immigrants has been one of the most contentious pieces of the reform debate .
Republicans have demanded more border security before giving any of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in America a shot at citizenship .
Mrs. Clinton ’ s announcement will complete her break from the tough immigration policies of her husband , former President Bill Clinton .

Vermont Sen. Bernard Sanders , the only other declared Democratic presidential candidate , also supports a path to citizenship .
On the Republican side , Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush support citizenship rights for illegal immigrants . Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker did support citizenship , but has since backed away from that stance .
