The president may be vacationing in a tropical paradise , but there 's no escaping the buffeting winds of troubled state health insurance exchanges , even in Hawaii .
For openers , the botched roll-out of the ObamaCare state exchange in Hawaii has hurt Democratic Gov . Neil Abercrombie 's approval ratings : 51 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say they do n't like the way he 's doing his job .
Already out of a job is Coral Andrews , the executive director of Hawaii 's state-run exchange . She submitted her resignation effective December 6 after only 257 people had signed up for health care a month into the roll out .
Hawaii 's website contract was awarded to the same firm , CGI , that blew the national Healthcare.gov roll out . CGI won the Hawaii contract even after the state senate president warned the state exchange director not to hire the firm . CGI apparently also had botched Hawaii 's tax website , costing Hawaiians $ 50 million to fix .
Hawaii is not alone . Oregon 's website never has worked , despite that state receiving more exchange grant money than any others , except California and New York .
Oregon applicants are forced to fill out a 19-page paper form but that , too , has been problematic . Despite assurances that coverage would take effect January 1 , late this month applicants began receiving robo-calls in which a voice told the applicant , `` If you have not heard from us by December 23rd , it is unlikely your application can be processed for January 1st insurance coverage . ''
Oregonian Harold Stanton received one of those calls and is no longer sure whether his health care insurance is effective come January 1 .
`` The governor should have been apprised of the situation . If he was n't apprised of the situation , then shame on his aides , and if he was , then shame on him for not listening to his aides , '' he says .
The director of Oregon ’ s exchange is now on medical leave .
Maryland , home to presumed Democratic presidential contender Gov . Martin O'Malley , also had a bad roll out .
Its exchange director is now gone , but lingering animosities remain . Gubernatorial hopeful Attorney General Doug Gansler fired off an intra-party salvo when he said the roll out was akin to a `` Saturday Night Live skit . '' The object of his wrath is lieutenant governor and gubernatorial front-runner Anthony Brown , who is also the chairman of the state panel on the health care roll out .
California has been touted as a state exchange success story . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi recently said of her state ’ s exchange , `` In Covered California , we 're moving along ( the ) largest state in the union , rolling along in a very positive way on it . ''
But what she did not say was that the state ’ s enrollment among Latinos has been weak .
Only five percent of enrollees are Latino , even though they make up more than half of California 's uninsured .
In a conference call with reporters Monday , Pelosi said the `` transformational '' nature of ObamaCare , much like Social Security , means that the law will take time to work out .
