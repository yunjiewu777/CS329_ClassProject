The smoking rate fell from 20.9 percent in 2005 to 17.8 percent in 2013 . That 's the lowest percentage since the Centers for Disease Control began surveying Americans on their smoking habits in 1965 — when more than 40 percent of American adults smoked . Cigarette smoking is still the leading preventable cause of death , killing more than 480,000 Americans annually .
The number of adult Americans smoking cigarettes fell from 45.1 million in 2005 to 42.1 million in 2013 — the lowest number that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded since it began surveying Americans on their smoking habits in 1965 .
Even among those who do smoke , the Centers for Disease Control found reason for optimism . The percent of smokers who said they smoked daily declined from 80.8 percent in 2005 to 76.9 percent in 2013 . And among daily smokers , the average number of cigarettes smoked daily dropped from 16.7 to 14.2 .
Declines in smoking are one of public health 's proudest success stories
Smoking rates have fallen rapidly since the mid-1960s , when the surgeon general first warned of the harms that nicotine poses . The federal government added warning labels to cigarette packages , and then began to ban television ads for tobacco in 1969 . In the 1970s , states began to ban smoking in public places . Indoor smoking bans followed in the 1990s .
At the same time , cigarette prices rose rapidly as states added excise taxes . The inflation-adjusted price for a pack of cigarettes grew from $ 1.80 in 1955 to $ 4.15 in 2008 .
Some public health efforts , like those that try and reduce obesity or increase exercise , can take years or decades to work . But these policy efforts to tamp down on smoking worked quickly : the American smoking rate fell by half between 1955 and 2008 , from 43 percent to 20 percent .
Even with all the gains , smoking is still a huge public health risk
There are still more than 42 million Americans who smoke , and rates tend to be especially high among minority and low-income populations .
`` Cigarette smoking remains especially high among certain groups , most notably those below the poverty level , those who have less education , Americans of multiple race , American Indians/Alaska Natives , males , those who live in the South or Midwest , those who have a disability or limitation , and those who are lesbian/gay/bisexual , '' the CDC finds .
Even as rates drop , smoking still remains the leading preventable cause of death in the United States . Smokers die , on average , 10 years earlier than non-smokers . And the federal government estimates that , for every one smoking death , there are 30 more smokers suffering from a related disease , like emphysema or lung cancer .
