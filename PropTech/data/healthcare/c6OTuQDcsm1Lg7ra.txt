( CNN ) - The person tasked with overseeing the development of HealthCare.gov is retiring , the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Monday .
The departure of Michelle Snyder , the chief operating officer at CMS who 's been in public service for 41 years , comes a few months after the bungled launch of the federal health care insurance website .
CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner noted in an email that Snyder was set to leave CMS at the end of 2012 but stayed on at Tavenner 's request to help with `` the challenges facing CMS in 2013 . ''
`` While the agency is losing a key member of its leadership team , we should celebrate Michelle 's dedication to a mission that provides vital health care services to tens of millions of our fellow Americans through the Medicare and Medicaid programs , '' Tavenner said .
Snyder is the second top CMS official to leave since the website 's rocky rollout . Tony Trenkle , who served as the agency 's chief information officer , retired in November .
Answering questions at an October congressional hearing , Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Snyder was the person in charge of the CMS team overseeing the website .
`` So Michelle Snyder is the one responsible for the debacle , '' Rep. Marsha Blackburn , R-Tennessee , said .
But Sebelius clarified : `` Excuse me , congresswoman , Michelle Snyder is not responsible for the debacle . Hold me accountable . I 'm responsible . ''
While CMS says most of HealthCare.gov 's errors have been fixed , the Obama administration still faces public perception issues as it seeks to bolster enrollment numbers .
The government announced Sunday more than 1.1 million people had enrolled in health care coverage through the federal marketplace between October 1 and December 24 .
That number does not include individuals who signed up for insurance through the state-run marketplaces in 14 states and the District of Columbia .
