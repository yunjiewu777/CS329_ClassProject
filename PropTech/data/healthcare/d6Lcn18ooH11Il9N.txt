`` Even if we accept all of the economic and moral reasons to providing affordable coverage to all Americans , there 's no denying that expanding coverage will come at a cost , at least in the short run . But it is a cost that will not , I repeat , will not , add to our deficits . I 've sent out a rule for my staff and my team and I 've said this to Congress , healthcare reform must be and will be deficit neutral in the next decade . ''
Most voters continue to have an unfavorable opinion of the health care law , and believe it will increase the nation ’ s deficit and drive up health care costs .
Forty-one percent ( 41 % ) of Likely Voters have at least a somewhat favorable impression of the health care law , while 54 % view it unfavorable , according to a new Rasmussen Reports telephone survey . This includes 20 % with a Very Favorable opinion of the law and 39 % with a Very Unfavorable one .
Fifty-three percent ( 53 % ) believe the health care law will increase the federal deficit . That ’ s the highest level measured in almost a year but is still down from 60 % just after the law ’ s passage . Seventeen percent ( 17 % ) say the law will reduce the deficit , while another 19 % believe it will have no impact .
Last year ’ s $ 1.087 trillion deficit was even greater in inflation-adjusted dollars than the peak World War II deficit of fiscal 1943—which was $ 54.554 billion in 1943 dollars and $ 723.8714 billion in 2012 dollars , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics online inflation calculator .
The deficit has also remained at a higher percentage of GDP over the last four years than at any time since the conclusion of World War II ( which ended during fiscal 1946 , which began in June 1945 ) .
In February , the CBO had initially calculated that the deficit for fiscal 2012 , which ended on Sept. 30 , 2012 , had been $ 10894 trillion . That was based on an estimation that the federal government had taken in $ 2.4491 trillion in taxes during the year and spent $ 3,5385 trillion .
In May , the CBO revised those figures , putting the fiscal 2012 deficit at $ 1.087 trillion , based on a slightly higher federal revenue intake of $ 2.4502 trillion and slightly lower spending of $ 3.5371 trillion .
Remember when Obama said this ? Three years after Obamacare 's passage , more than half of Americans are n't buying it and think Obama 's signature legislation will increase the deficit , not decrease it.According to the Congressional Budget Office , the budget deficit for 2012 was a whopping $ 1.087 trillion , the fourth year in a row the United States has seen a trillion dollar deficit . CNSNews has more on these numbers : Got that ? The short version of this whole thing is that the government is spending $ 1 trillion more than it takes in . The deficit will never be neutral with this continued style of spending and considering Obamacare is going to cost at least $ 3 trillion over the next ten years , we 're in major trouble .
