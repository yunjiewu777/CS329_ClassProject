So while lawmakers from both parties are privately relying on the White House and its agencies to provide technical information to draft scores of amendments to the immigration bill , few Republicans are willing to admit it . Some are so eager to prove that the White House is not pulling the strings that their aides say the administration is not playing any role at all .
“ President Obama ’ s concept of engaging Congress is giving a speech that nobody up here listens to , ” said Alex Conant , a spokesman for Senator Marco Rubio , Republican of Florida , who is an important supporter of the immigration legislation . “ If passing legislation is like making sausage , then this White House is like a bunch of vegetarians . ”
As senators near a final tally on the 867-page bill before the July 4 holiday , immigration supporters acknowledge serious risks in Mr. Obama ’ s approach : leaving the public advocacy for a major piece of his legacy in the hands of others . If the bill fails to become law , Mr. Obama will be open to criticism from Hispanics that he did not put the weight of his office behind the legislation .
But Mr. Obama has made some careful public efforts , including a speech last week at the White House in which he strongly endorsed the legislation . On Tuesday while on Air Force One in Europe , he called a Democratic negotiator , Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York , to reinforce his opposition to part of a Republican amendment that would have what the administration views as unrealistically tough requirements for border security .
Inside Room 201 , the administration has gathered a collection of its own Congressional lobbyists , policy specialists and experts from an alphabet soup of the agencies that will have to put the immigration legislation into effect if it passes . They all moved into the vice president ’ s offices on June 10 , setting up laptop computers and thick binders filled with proposed amendments on an oval conference table .
