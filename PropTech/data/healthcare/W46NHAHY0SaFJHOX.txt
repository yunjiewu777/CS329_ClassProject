The phrase “ good enough for government work ” used to be a boast . Then it became an insult . With Obamacare , it is an ethic .
On Cyber Monday , the federal government was the only entity on the planet touting a commercial website with the promise that it would work most of the time , provided people visiting during peak hours were willing to take a number and come back later .
Although HealthCare.gov was still plagued by what used to be known as “ glitches , ” it was working better . In fact , it appears to be well on the way to being fixed—except for the part where people pay for and actually get insurance . That is called the “ backend , ” or the payment system without which any other business would go bust . To be charitable , it is still a work in progress .
The line in the administration ’ s progress report about the technical team working “ with private sector velocity and effectiveness ” said it all . No one would ever brag about working “ with public sector velocity and effectiveness. ” Certainly not anyone who works in the private sector .
Yet it is the government that is vastly increasing its reach via Obamacare . Explaining away the troubles of his signature initiative , President Barack Obama pledged on Tuesday , “ We ’ re going to keep on working to fix whatever problems come up in any startup , any launch of a project this big that has an impact on one-sixth of our economy . ”
Startups don ’ t ordinarily affect one-sixth of the economy . Usually , no one hears about them unless they prove successes , and by then they are reliably functional . The president is surely correct that any vast experiment affecting one-sixth of the economy will inevitably have pitfalls—which is why it is foolhardy to undertake one .
Obama is confident his law will work because , as he repeatedly says , “ The product is good. ” The leader of the free world is now a glorified insurance salesman . At times he sounds like a poor man ’ s Billy Mays—you may be eligible , he enthused on Tuesday , for tax credits “ that can save you hundreds of dollars in premium costs every month. ” He said everything but “ Order Now ! ”
