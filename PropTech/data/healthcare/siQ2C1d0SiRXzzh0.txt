WASHINGTON — The share of young adults without health insurance fell by one-sixth in 2011 from the previous year , the largest annual decline for any age group since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began collecting the data in 1997 , according to a new report released on Monday .
The estimates are drawn from a federal survey of about 35,000 households . It did not ask how the newly insured obtained coverage , but the study ’ s author , Matthew Broaddus , a research analyst at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , said the increased coverage for young people was almost certainly due to a provision in the Obama administration ’ s Affordable Care Act that allows children to stay on their parents ’ insurance policies until their 26th birthday .
Joseph Antos , a health care policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , agreed that the provision of the new law was the only plausible explanation for the increase . He pointed out that young people have been among the hardest hit in the recession and would otherwise have been expected to be less likely to be insured . “ Nothing else went well for this age group , ” he said .
The share of people ages 19 to 25 who lacked health insurance fell to 27.9 percent , down from 33.9 percent in 2010 , or about 1.6 million fewer uninsured people , according to the data from the federal study , known as the National Health Interview Survey . For the next age group — those 26 to 35 years old — the share of the uninsured rose , a further sign , Mr. Broaddus said , that the health care law was driving the decline among the younger group .
The dependents ’ provision of the health care law took effect in September 2010 , and the number of uninsured young adults declined that year , too , though by a smaller amount . Obama administration officials said that drop showed that the law , which was broadly opposed by Republicans , was having an effect .
