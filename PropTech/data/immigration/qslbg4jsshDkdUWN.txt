Stop us if you ’ ve heard this before , but one of Donald Trump ’ s most shocking claims about a southern border wall has proven a bit exaggerated . The president claimed in Friday ’ s bizarre Rose Garden presser that several of his predecessors “ have told me that we should have ” built a wall between the U.S. and Mexico , though he declined to name which former presidents supported it . Perhaps unsurprisingly , representatives for the Bush family and Bill Clinton have denied the allegation .
“ This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me , and they all know it , ” Trump said . “ Some of them have told me that we should have done it . ”
Clinton spokesperson Angel Ureña explicitly refuted the president ’ s assertion , adding that the two men have “ not talked since the inauguration. ” Bush representative Freddy Ford said the wall has never been discussed between the two . Former president George H.W . Bush died in November , though it is seen as unlikely that he and Trump had any significant discussion of a wall . Trump has famously kept his distance from the Bush family in the wake of past comments and a 2016 presidential campaign rivalry with Jeb Bush . Trump did not attend the funeral of former First Lady Barbara Bush in April .
That just leaves former presidents Barack Obama and Jimmy Carter , both of whom have criticized Trump ’ s positions on immigration . An Obama spokesperson reportedly declined comment , though Obama himself has come out against the wall on numerous occasions . Carter , like Obama , has pushed for technological advancements to strengthen U.S. border security , according to The New York Times , but not the kind of wall that Trump is seeking $ 5 billion to build . A senior administration official reportedly suggested that Trump was “ referring to public comments his predecessors have made about the need for border security , not necessarily for a wall specifically . ”
