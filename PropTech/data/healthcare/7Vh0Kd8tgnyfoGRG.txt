Obamacare has `` perverse incentives '' that allow employers to cut their employees ' work hours , says Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins , who has introduced a bill to change the healthcare law 's definition of full time work from 30 hours a week to 40.Collins , in Saturday 's GOP address , noted that under Obamacare , anyone working an average of 30 hours a week is considered full-time , meaning many employers may cut their hours so they wo n't have to provide them with insurance.A 40-hour work week is full-time , we all know that , '' said Collins.She noted in her address that her family founded a small business in Maine more than 160 years ago that continues to be run by two of her brothers . `` Our economy is built on millions of enterprises just like ours , '' she said . `` It ’ s not easy to survive in today ’ s economy . But these employers remain our nation ’ s job creators . We should be doing all we can to promote policies to help them survive and thrive . `` She also agreed that healthcare reform should provide people with access to quality and affordable care `` while encouraging economic growth . That ’ s not what is happening under Obamacare . `` Instead , Collins said , Obamacare discourages small businesses from creating jobs and hiring new workers , and `` has perverse incentives for employers to reduce the number of hours that their employees can work . `` Most small businesses want to provide health insurance , said Collins , but ca n't afford to do so under Obamacare.In addition , she said , that while businesses with 50 or more full-time employees are required to provide health insurance or face huge fines , they wo n't face fines if they only have 49 employees . `` These enormous penalties are a real threat to employers who want to add jobs , '' she said . `` They are a powerful incentive for employers to refrain from hiring additional workers . `` But even worse , Collins said , is the Obamacare provision that calls people who work 30 hour weeks full-time . `` This will only cause some businesses to reluctantly reduce the hours of their workers to fewer than 30 hours per week , '' she noted.The public sector is also being affected , Collins said , telling of one school system in her state that is preparing to cap substitute teachers ' work at no more than 29 hours a week.She also quoted Teamsters President James Hoffa , who said recently that Obamacare will `` destroy the foundation of the 40-hour work week that is the backbone of the American middle class . `` `` They are right to be worried , '' said Collins . `` In the past , most new jobs were full-time . But , this year , the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part-time . `` She also quoted a study from the Labor Center at the University of California , Berkeley , which said 10 million workers could have their hours cut because of Obamacare.Collins admitted her `` common sense '' bill `` wo n't solve the countless problems caused by Obamacare . But it would help ensure that millions of American workers do not have their hours , and their paychecks , reduced . ''
