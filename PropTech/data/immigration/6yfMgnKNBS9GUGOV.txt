In news that ’ s surely a relief to Republicans in the House and Senate , Donald Trump has informed them they can all stop pretending to address the immigration issue . In a series of morning tweets , Trump declared that “ Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration ” until the fall elections , because Democrats will only defeat any bills they put forward in the Senate . Then Trump went on to blame Democrats for the failure of the harsh Goodlatte immigration bill , which could not even gain enough Republican votes to make it out of the GOP-dominated House .
x Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November . Dems are just playing games , have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem . We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 22 , 2018
Trump spent more of his time hammering his false accusations about Democrats and crime , and predicting a “ Red Wave ” —which makes it seem that Donald Trump doesn ’ t quite get how this “ metaphor ” thing works . He might have at least gone with “ red tide , ” which is a thing , a suffocating , odorous mass of scum thing … but still a thing .
But as Trump ’ s PJ-clad executive time spreads out to capture more and more of his day , he generated extensive tweets : promoting an upcoming 90-minute hate in South Carolina , promoting a series of GOP candidates based on how well they pass the Toady for Trump exam , and pausing for an insta-book promotion for yet another Fox “ expert. ” This marks an even dozen book promotion tweets from Trump in just the last two months . It ’ s only a matter of time before he begins simply repeating the commercials on Fox & Friends word for word .
Notably missing from Trump ’ s morning sampler—any mention of family separation . Because that problem has already been “ solved . ”
