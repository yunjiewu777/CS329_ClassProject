An angry group of lockdown protesters verbally abused and “ practically chased ” a Long Island reporter — with one man remarking , “ I got hydroxychloroquine , I ’ m fine . ”
News 12 Long Island reporter Kevin Vesey captured the crowd , which included President Trump supporters shouting “ Fake news ! ” and “ Enemy of the people ! , ” in Commack on Thursday while reporting on the protest and posted the footage to Twitter .
“ The level of anger directed at the media from these protestors was alarming . As always , I will tell a fair and unbiased story today , ” he wrote .
In the videos , Vesey repeatedly asks protesters to stay at least six feet away — but is met with a barrage of insults .
“ I think you need to back away from me , man , ” the reporter can be heard saying in one of the clips .
“ No , I got hydroxychloroquine , I ’ m fine , ” the unnamed protester says as he continues to walk toward the reporter and gives him the finger .
The anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has been touted by Trump as a coronavirus treatment . The FDA warned late last month against the use of the drug outside a hospital .
“ You can see there ’ s clearly a lot of anger here today , ” Vesey says as he backs away from a woman shouting at him with a bullhorn in one of the clips .
In another clip , the crowd chants , “ Fake news is not essential ” as Vesey walks through the protest .
One man gives the reporter the finger and says , “ F–k you , you guys are f–king fake news ” — while a woman calls the reporter “ disgusting ” and says “ You ’ re the virus ” as she walks away , the video shows .
The protest was organized by the Setauket Patriots , a pro-Trump group from Long Island .
The group posted an article about the protest and commented , “ Journalism 101 : Don ’ t let yourself become part of the story… .. ”
According to News 12 , Suffolk County police talked to protesters about social distancing but issued no summonses .
