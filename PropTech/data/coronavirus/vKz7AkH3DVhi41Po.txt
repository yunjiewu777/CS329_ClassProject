One senator thinks her colleagues should share the financial pain of the Americans being laid off as a result of the coronavirus epidemic .
Sen. Martha McSally , Arizona Republican , introduced a bill Tuesday that would withhold pay from all senators until they pass a COVID-19 relief and support package .
“ If Americans aren ’ t getting paid , then neither should the Senators failing to support the workers and families who need help making ends meet , ” Ms. McSally said in a statement .
Senate Democrats have twice blocked votes on a relief bill that would spend hundreds of billions on coronavirus work and economic support , and House Democrats have pushed a bill larded with such non-coronavirus-related provisions as diversity requirements , pro-union rules , airline-emission requirements and a $ 15 minimum-wage requirement .
Republicans have accused them of playing politics , pushing a “ socialist wish list ” with a potential national catastrophe at stake .
“ It is despicable that millions of Americans are without a paycheck in this time of crisis , while the Senate wastes precious time playing political games . The Senate must pass this relief package now in order to get cash straight to the people , ” Ms. McSally said .
Ms. McSally ’ s bill is unlikely to pass as long as the relief bill itself can ’ t pass . But another Republican lawmaker took a concrete step of his own Tuesday .
Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina said he would decline his salary until a coronavirus relief package has passed on Capitol Hill and urged other lawmakers to follow suit .
“ Struggling Americans don ’ t need the political tactics and radical agenda-setting of the DC political class while they face a crisis , ” Mr. Walker said . “ Until they can get over their bickering , I urge my colleagues to join me in forgoing pay until they can choose people over politics and get a relief bill to President Trump ’ s desk . ”
