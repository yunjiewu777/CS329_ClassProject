Housing & Urban Development Secretary Dr. Ben Carson told `` The Story '' Thursday that not enough public attention is being paid to `` the number of people who have recovered '' from coronavirus '' -- which Carson said `` is going to be about 98 percent of all the people who get it . ''
Carson , a one-time Baltimore pediatric neurosurgeon , added that between one-quarter and one-half of all people infected with coronavirus are asymptomatic .
`` You probably do know someone that has it , you may have it , who knows ? '' Carson told host Martha MacCallum . `` But people have been terrified because we 've talked about the bad . ''
Carson emphasized that Americans should continue practicing social distancing and follow the other guidelines from the White House coronavirus task force , of which he is a member . He added that now is not the time for people to let their guard down .
The secretary added that when it comes to reopening the U.S. economy , the government must watch for the infection curve to be at a low enough point , as well as for sufficient antibody testing to be online .
`` When we see that bell-shaped curve -- and we 've seen it come down rather steeply in some other countries -- when that happens [ and ] we have n't seen it go back up , that 's what we are looking for here , '' he said . `` That already seems to be starting . ''
`` Obviously , we do n't want to [ resume economic activity ] too early . We will wait for a couple of weeks and see if that continues down and then we also need to make sure that we have appropriate testing . ''
`` We have to be able to test people to see if they have the antibodies which will make them much safer in terms of returning to the workforce . And then we have to return them in a logical way . That 's the key . ''
At the same time , Carson acknowledged that if we `` destroy the economic infrastructure of our country , '' there will be more hardship than there has been from the virus itself .
`` We ca n't operate out of hysteria , '' Carson said . `` When people are hysterical they do n't do logical things . ''
