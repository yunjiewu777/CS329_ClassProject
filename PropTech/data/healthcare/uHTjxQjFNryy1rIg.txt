Democrats spent heavily to win the Virginia governorship Tuesday , but Republicans said by making the race far closer than polls had projected just a few weeks ago , Kenneth T. Cuccinelli ’ s campaign showed how much of a weapon Obamacare can be in the hands of the GOP .
In the two biggest elections of the night — the New Jersey and Virginia governor ’ s races — neither Democratic candidate topped 50 percent . Indeed , between purple-state Virginia and deep-blue New Jersey , the Republican candidates combined for 2.2 million votes , or 400,000 more than the Democratic candidates .
The results will leave many Republicans wondering about what-ifs in Virginia , including what would have happened if the GOP in Washington hadn ’ t gotten caught up in a government shutdown for most of October , and if major donors had pumped a little more money into the race in the closing days .
“ If we had had five more days , or 5 million more dollars , we would have won , ” said Michael McKenna , a Republican strategist in Virginia , who also said Tuesday ’ s results will be studied by candidates heading into the next two federal elections . “ Obamacare is toxic . Democratic senators up in either 2014 or 2016 are probably terrified at what happened in Virginia . ”
New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie ’ s easy path to re-election underscored how well Republicans can do when they are seen as strong leaders — even when voters disagree with them on specific issues such as gay marriage or taxes . In Virginia , meanwhile , exit polling showed voters fed up with both Mr. Cuccinelli and Mr. McAuliffe , though the electorate appeared to fear the Republican more than the Democrat .
Still , the final results in Virginia were far closer than polls suggested just days ago .

At the end of the government shutdown , Mr. McAuliffe held leads of as much as 17 percentage points . But with the shutdown over , Mr. Cuccinelli and national Republican figures argued that Virginia ’ s election was a referendum on Obamacare — and the polls began to tighten , ending with Mr. McAuliffe ’ s narrow 2 percentage-point victory on Tuesday .
Exit polling showed 41 percent of Virginians “ strongly oppose ” the health care law , while only 27 percent “ strongly support ” the law . Of voters who said health care was the most important issue in their vote , Mr. Cuccinelli topped Mr. McAuliffe , 49 percent to 45 percent .
Mr. Cuccinelli ’ s big stumble came on social issues , with a large chunk of voters saying abortion was their chief concern , and Mr. McAuliffe overwhelmingly winning those voters , 59 percent to 34 percent .
That showing will give ammunition to Democrats who say their party should continue to accuse Republicans of a war on women — a message that helped Mr. Obama win re-election last year .
In New Jersey , the polling on Obamacare was a little closer , with 34 percent strongly opposed and 23 percent strongly supporting it .
Liberal groups said they welcomed viewing election night as a referendum on Obamacare , since Virginia did end up going Democratic in both the governor ’ s race and the lieutenant governor ’ s race .
“ Advantage : Obamacare , ” said Americans United for Change , a group run by the former spokesman for the national Democratic Party .
Current Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement that the Virginia victories showed just how badly the government shutdown hurt Republicans .
“ Tonight in Virginia , we saw voters reject the extreme tea party politics that caused our government to shut down and drove our economy to the brink of collapse , ” she said .
While there ’ s little doubt Mr. Cuccinelli turned off voters , so did Mr. McAuliffe . Exit polling showed just 52 percent said they strongly backed the man they voted for , while 17 percent said they voted for their choice because they disliked the others .
Mr. McAuliffe won half of those voters , signaling his margin of victory came not because voters were eager to see him in office , but because they were wary of Mr. Cuccinelli .
A Libertarian candidate , Robert C. Sarvis , won 6.6 percent of the vote , which was well more than the slim margin of victory for Mr. McAuliffe . Mr. Sarvis won almost all of his support from voters who simply disliked the two major-party offerings .
