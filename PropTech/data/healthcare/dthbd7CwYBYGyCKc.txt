For more than five hours on Wednesday , the House Republican who helped saved his party ’ s health care bill faced jeers from hundreds of protesters , cries for socialized medicine , personal attacks , and even an attack ad flown by a plane .
Rep. Tom MacArthur ( R-NJ ) , who co-authored the American Health Care Act amendment allowing states opt out of preexisting conditions to get the bill over the finish line last week , stomached the ferocious criticism from a crowd of more than 200 people at a community center in Willingboro , New Jersey .

Video from the event shows a procession of voters rising to challenge MacArthur on his amendment , asking why the AHCA slashes taxes for the rich and about its impact on coverage . Most of the audience members rose to their feet at one point after someone asked who had a preexisting condition .

Inside the hall , the Washington Post ’ s David Weigel captured how the fury of the crowd prevented MacArthur from trying to deflate the anger from the get-go :
MacArthur presented himself as an empathetic , pragmatic legislator who had to represent “ one of the few real swing seats. ” But he rarely got a break . He opened with a story that , in other settings , would have been a gut punch — the decision to raise a daughter with special needs and to take her off life support when , at 11 years old , she passed away . He could hardly get the story out , as angry constituents accused him of diverting the discussion from his health-care bill . “ We know about your daughter , ” yelled one constituent .
Outside the event , hundreds came to rally , chant , sing , and stage a “ die-in ” over the AHCA . A plane commissioned by MoveOn.org flew overhead , with a banner accusing MacArthur of “ tax cuts for no care . ”

At least MacArthur showed up to the town hall . More than 200 House Republicans who voted for the bill have canceled these traditional constituent interactions — perhaps because they didn ’ t want to face the kinds of crowds MacArthur did .
MacArthur is likely one of the many Republicans worried about his seat in 2018 . He easily won reelection in 2016 , but Democrats didn ’ t appear to have put up a serious challenger . Frederick Lavergne , who rarely talked to the press , only raised about $ 600 for his campaign . Lavergne ’ s campaign website was also filled with quotes in Latin , and quotes 19th-century novelist Gustave Flaubert as saying , `` You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies . ''
Left-wing activists are optimistic that the outrage over the health care bill can be channeled into defeating House Republicans like MacArthur .
`` Trumpcare touches every single person in this country , and it 's been an issue everyone can get and mobilize behind . It 's been the unifying issue for the resistance , ” said Sarah Dohl , a spokesperson for the political activism group Indivisible .
