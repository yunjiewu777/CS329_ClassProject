Obamacare ’ s troubled rollout still is dominating the headlines , but President Obama on Saturday tried to change the conversation and turn attention toward his priorities in budget negotiations with congressional Republicans .
In his weekly address , the president stressed he ’ s willing to “ go anywhere and do anything ” to grow the economy , create jobs and maintain government investment in areas such as education .
“ Priorities . Choices . That ’ s what this is about . And the stakes for the middle class couldn ’ t be higher , ” Mr. Obama said . “ If we don ’ t pick the right priorities now , make the right choices now , we could hinder growth and opportunity for decades , and leave our children with something else . ”
The president also took aim at the sequestration cuts — put in place as part of 2011 ’ s Budget Control Act — which he says “ hasn ’ t helped our economy grow ; it ’ s held it back . ”
Mr. Obama ’ s address was short on specifics , but it did offer clues to the administration ’ s overall approach to budget negotiations .
As part of last month ’ s deal to end the government shutdown and raise the nation ’ s debt limit , congressional leaders agreed to sit down for formal fiscal talks . The White House is stressing that it won ’ t accept a spending plan that simply makes more cuts .
Instead , the administration is looking for certain tax hikes — such as the elimination of so-called “ loopholes ” for energy companies — and increased spending in areas such as infrastructure , education and others .
“ Congress should pass a budget that cuts things we don ’ t need , and closes wasteful tax loopholes that don ’ t help create jobs so that we can free up resources for the things that actually do create jobs and growth , ” Mr. Obama said . “ The question can ’ t be how much more we can cut ; it ’ s got to be how many more jobs we can create , how many more kids we can educate , and how much more shared prosperity we can generate . ”
