Andy and Amy Mangione of Louisville , Ky. and their two boys are just the kind of people who should be helped by ObamaCare . But they recently got a nasty surprise in the mail .
`` When I saw the letter when I came home from work , '' Andy said , describing the large red wording on the envelope from his insurance carrier , `` ( it said ) 'your action required , benefit changes , act now . ' Of course I opened it immediately . ''
It had stunning news . Insurance for the Mangiones and their two boys , which they bought on the individual market , was going to almost triple in 2014 -- - from $ 333 a month to $ 965 .
The insurance carrier made it clear the increase was in order to be compliant with the new health care law .
`` This is n't a Cadillac plan , this is n't even a silver plan , '' Mangione said , referring to higher levels of coverage under ObamaCare .
`` This is a high deductible plan where I 'm assuming a lot of risk for my health insurance for my family . And nothing has changed , our boys are healthy -- they 're young -- my wife is healthy . I 'm healthy , nothing in our medical history has changed to warrant a tripling of our premiums .
`` Well I 'm the one that does the budget , ” said his wife . `` Eventually I 've got that coming down the pike that I got ta figure out what we 're gon na cut what we 're gon na do , to afford a $ 1,000 a month premium . ''
Their insurance company , Humana , declined to comment , but the notice to the Mangiones carried this paragraph :
`` If your policy premium increased , you should know this is n't unique to Humana -- premium increases generally will occur industry-wide .
`` Increases are n't based on your individual claims or changes in health status , '' it continued . `` Many other factors go in to your premium including : ACA compliance , including the addition of new essential health benefits . ''
ACA , of course , is the abbreviation for the President 's new law , the Affordable Care Act -- which for the Mangiones will be anything but affordable because the law adds a new tax on every insurance policy and requires a list of additional benefits the Mangiones didn ’ t want to pay for .
Robert Zirkelbach , spokesman for American Health Insurance Plans , which represents insurers , explained that `` for people who currently choose to purchase a high deductible , low premium policy that 's more affordable for them , they are now being required to add all these new benefits to their policy .
That , '' he says , `` is also going to add to the cost of their health insurance premiums . ''
This comes amid a huge debate over whether ObamaCare will raise or lower insurance rates .
