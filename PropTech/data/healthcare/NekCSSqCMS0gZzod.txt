Earlier this week , in an effort led by Sen. Ted Cruz , some of my Republican colleagues and I took to the Senate floor with the intent of making Washington listen . The American people have made it abundantly clear that they do not want Obamacare . In fact , a majority of elected officials , the same officials that voted to implement this health care mandate , do not want it , either .
Last summer , in a 5-4 decision authored by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. , the Supreme Court wrongly concluded that Obamacare ’ s individual mandate could stand . As a consequence of the court ’ s ruling , starting on Oct. 1 , whether they want it or not , Americans will be compelled to purchase a government-mandated product — health insurance — or pay a tax .
What should infuriate you the most is the fact that the same elected officials who implemented this mandate have recently declared themselves exempt from it . That is to say , these officials are forcing you to partake in something that they themselves are refusing . If Obamacare is so great , why then are federal employees and elected officials getting special treatment and opting out ?
If President Obama , Rep. Nancy Pelosi , Sen. Harry Reid and Chief Justice Roberts love Obamacare so much , they should live under it . Their actions speak louder than words , and it is erroneous for these leaders to even attempt to claim that Obamacare is a step forward for Americans .
The American people do not approve of the Obamacare mandate and flocked to town halls across the country to let their representatives know it . In fact , only 12 percent of Americans think Obamacare will have a positive impact on their lives , according to a recent NBC-Wall Street Journal poll .
Headlines across the nation shows the harm Obamacare is imposing on Americans : “ Georgia Healthcare Company Cuts 101 Employees due to Obamacare , ” “ Michigan School District Cuts Hours for Employees Because of Obamacare , ” “ Cleveland Clinic Announces Job Cuts to Prepare for Obamacare ” and “ Small Businesses Consider Dropping Healthcare Plans Under Obamacare , ” just to name a few .
Before the Obamacare health insurance exchanges open on Oct. 1 , we are already witnessing the negative effects this mandate is having on those it intended to help . We can not even begin to fathom all of the negative effects Obamacare holds .
Based on separate analyses from Congressional Budget Office and Deloitte , between 20 million and 65 million Americans could lose their employer-sponsored health insurance policies , and according to the CBO , the health care reform law will destroy 800,000 jobs .
An analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the CBO from September 2012 shows that in 2016 , half of the tax imposed by the individual mandate will fall on those making an annual income of less than $ 120,000 for a family of four , or $ 59,000 for an individual . Families of four making $ 72,000 or less ( and individuals making $ 35,400 or less ) will bear 35 percent of the mandate tax . This is a direct tax on the middle class .
Through its proposed $ 1 trillion in tax increases , the $ 716 billion in Medicare cuts , and the individual mandates and regulations , it is clear that Obamacare will swiftly harm our country .
I find it absolutely despicable that Mr. Obama , his administration and the elected officials who shoved this mandate down the throat of Americans are now giving themselves waivers . The president is also giving his friends waivers . Mr. Obama ’ s behavior mirrors that of a captain jumping overboard , abandoning his own sinking ship .
I have a proposal . I have offered an amendment that would outlaw any special exemptions for government employees . This amendment requires all federal workers to purchase health insurance from the new Obamacare exchanges , instead of receiving taxpayer-funded subsidies .
I am also introducing a more broad constitutional amendment , which states that Congress shall make no law that treats citizens differently from the elites in the federal government .
Political leaders such as Mr. Obama and Mrs. Pelosi need to realize that they are not above the American people , and they are not above our laws , period . If Chief Justice Roberts thinks it is OK for the federal government to tax individuals if they don ’ t buy expensive private health insurance plans , he should be forced into Obamacare ’ s government-centered health care system . Members of Congress should also be forced to suffer under the same flawed health care system that Washington wants to use as a social experiment on the American people .
My legislation and constitutional amendment will remind all elected officials that they are not above the law , and they are certainly not above the American people .
