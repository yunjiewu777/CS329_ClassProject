In a Saturday night keynote address to the Maverick PAC conference Vice President Mike Pence rattled off a list of President Trump 's accomplishments , noting that in seven months he 's signed 40 bills and 40 Executive Orders , approved the Keystone and Dakota Pipelines , rolled back the Obama clean power plan , withdrew from Paris Climate Accord , and 800,000 new jobs have been created .
Though the stock market is soaring and consumer confidence is high , Pence said , one thing that must be addressed right away is the implosion of Obamacare .
Obamacare is literally imploding . The average premium on the individual market has more than doubled since Obamacare went into effect , and in many states it 's more than tripled . The Average Obamacare plan today costs $ 3,000 more than it did in 2013 .
Pence expressed confidence that the Better Care Act would pass , though at least two GOP senators have said they will not vote for it .
“ We 're on the verge of a historic accomplishment here in our nation ’ s capital , because in the coming days , President Trump , working with the Congress that you helped elect , is going to keep our promise to the American people , and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare . “ Just two days ago , building on the good work of the House of Representatives , Senate leadership unveiled a new version of the Senate health care bill . The Senate health care bill is the right bill at the right time to begin to repeal and replace Obamacare , and to rescue the American people from this disastrous policy . ”
Saturday night , Sen. Mitch McConnell announced that the bill would not be taken up in the Senate until Sen. John McCain returns to Washington . McCain had surgery in his home state of Arizona to remove a blood clot from above his eye and will recuperate there for the next week .
Last week , Pence told Rush Limbaugh that if the Senate was unable to pass this bill , they should pass a simple repeal then work on an entirely new plan .
