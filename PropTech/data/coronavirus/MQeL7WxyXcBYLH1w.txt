A FOX 35 investigation released on Monday discovered an inflation of coronavirus cases by the Florida Department of Health . The Sunshine State ’ s health authorities misreported the number of persons testing positive for coronavirus in its aggregation and publication of test results from laboratories .
FOX 35 anchor Charles Billi explained the impetus for the investigation . He said , “ We found numerous labs that are only reporting positive test results , so they show a 100-percent positivity rate . That got our attention . ”
According to the latest publication of statewide test results from the Florida Department of Health , published on Friday , several testing facilities ’ positivity rates for coronavirus tests were 27.66 , 33.33 , 37.10 , 40 , 43.13 , 44.44 , 50 , 55 , 57.14 , 59.23 , 60 , 87.5 , 91.18 , and 100 .
Twenty-two labs reported 100-percent positivity rates . Two labs reported 91.18-percent positivity rates .
The Florida Department of Health ’ s stated positivity rates and associated volume of coronavirus cases does not match claims made by the testing facilities , reported FOX 35 :
Countless labs have reported a 100 percent positivity rate , which means every single person tested was positive . Other labs had very high positivity rates . FOX 35 found that testing sites like Centra Care reported that 83 people were tested and all tested positive . Then , NCF Diagnostics in Alachua reported 88 percent of tests were positive . How could that be ? FOX 35 News investigated these astronomical numbers , contacting every local location mentioned in the report . The report showed that Orlando Health had a 98 percent positivity rate . However , when FOX 35 News contacted the hospital , they confirmed errors in the report . Orlando Health ’ s positivity rate is only 9.4 percent , not 98 percent as in the report .
“ The report also showed that the Orlando Veteran ’ s Medical Center had a positivity rate of 76 percent , ” added FOX 35 . “ A spokesperson for the VA told FOX 35 News on Tuesday that this does not reflect their numbers and that the positivity rate for the center is actually 6 percent . ”
“ FOX 35 News went on to speak with the Florida Department of Health on Tuesday . They confirmed that although private and public laboratories are required to report positive and negative results to the state immediately , some have not . Specifically , they said that some smaller , private labs were not reporting negative test result data to the state . ”
FOX 35 ’ s Robert Guaderrama is awaiting a response from state officials regarding the health department ’ s errors :
Florida has a statewide positivity rate of 12.5 percent , according to the state ’ s latest claims of 266,119 “ confirmed cases ” among Florida residents against a state population of nearly 21.5 million .
