`` That has to be also part of it , '' McCain told ███ ' Martha Raddatz on `` This Week '' when asked whether a pathway to citizenship would be a component of reform . `` There 's a new appreciation on both sides of the aisle including , maybe more importantly on the Republican side of the aisle , that we have to enact comprehensive immigration reform .

Menendez , who met with President Obama on Friday along with other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus leadership , said that the president expressed his full commitment to reform .
`` The president made it very clear in that discussion that this was a top legislative priority for him in this session of the Congress and that he expects to work with all of us in an effort to achieve that goal and he 's fully committed to it . ''
He added that a pathway to `` earned legalization '' is an `` essential element '' of an immigration reform bill .
`` First , Americans support it in poll after poll . Secondly , Latino voters expect it . Thirdly Democrats want it . And fourth Republicans need it , '' Menendez said .
McCain added that he believes Obama 's use of the presidential podium on behalf of immigration reform at an event in Las Vegas planned for Tuesday will aid efforts to pass a bill .
`` I think it helps , '' McCain said . `` I think its important that we all work together on this . ''
`` Believe it or not , I see a glimmer of bipartisanship out there , '' he added .
