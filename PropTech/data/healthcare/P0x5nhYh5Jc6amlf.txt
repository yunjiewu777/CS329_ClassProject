President Obama , looking to win the public relations battle over a looming government shutdown , took his case directly to voters this weekend .
In his regular radio address Saturday , the president told Americans that an “ extreme faction ” of the House GOP is risking an economic calamity to torpedo his health care law .
“ In the next couple days , these Republicans will have to decide whether to join the Senate and keep the government open , or create a crisis that will hurt people for the sole purpose of advancing their ideological agenda , ” Mr. Obama said .
Mr. Obama ’ s supporters followed up Sunday on Facebook and Twitter with a daylong stream of posts citing the crisis in fundraising appeals and urging backers to contact lawmakers and weigh in on behalf of the Affordable Care Act — the comprehensive health care law that Republicans have sought to defund .
But a top House Republican said the president is ignoring a “ golden opportunity ” to address Washington ’ s spending and debt problems .
“ He wants to take the easy way out — exactly the kind of foolishness that got us here in the first place , ” said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers , Washington Republican , in the GOP ’ s weekly address .

Congress and the president must agree on a short-term spending bill by midnight Monday to keep the federal government running .
Enrollment in new health-insurance exchanges is set to start Tuesday , just as the government would close for business — a deadline noted by the president in his address .
“ The Affordable Care Act is one of the most important things we ’ ve done as a country in decades to strengthen economic security for the middle class and all who strive to join the middle class , ” Mr. Obama said . “ That ’ s also one of the reasons it ’ s so disturbing that Republicans in Congress are threatening to shut down the government — or worse — if I don ’ t agree to gut this law . ”
The president also criticized Republicans for seeking to negotiate with him over a proposal to raise the nation ’ s borrowing limit . Without an increase in the debt ceiling by mid-October , the government would default on some of its obligations .
“ Unfortunately some Republicans have suggested that unless I agree to an even longer list of demands — not just gutting the health care law , but things like cutting taxes for millionaires or rolling back rules on big banks and polluters — they ’ ll push the button , throwing America into default for the first time in history and risk throwing us back into recession , ” Mr. Obama said . “ No one gets to hurt our economy and millions of innocent people just because there are a couple laws you don ’ t like . It hasn ’ t been done in the past , and we ’ re not going to start doing it now . ”
But Mrs. McMorris Rodgers noted that presidents have routinely negotiated with lawmakers in the past when reaching agreements to increase borrowing , from Ronald Reagan to Bill Clinton to Mr. Obama himself in 2011 .
“ Every major deficit reduction effort of the last 30 years has been tied to the debt limit . This time should be no different , ” she said .
“ Unfortunately , the president is now demanding that we increase the debt limit without engaging in any kind of bipartisan discussions about addressing our spending problem . ”
She said House Republicans have put forward a plan that “ contains cuts and real reforms to build a 21st century economy — from approving the Keystone pipeline and fixing our outdated tax code to delaying the president ’ s health care law . ”
