By a 54-41 percent margin , American voters would get rid of the sweeping 2010 health care law if given the option , according to a new ███ poll .
The poll , released Wednesday , also shows most voters -- 71 percent -- think the more than 15,000 pages of regulations that implement the Affordable Care Act , popularly known as Obamacare , are “ way over the top. ” Some 19 percent say that number of pages “ seems about right . ”
The concern about the small mountain of health care rules is bipartisan . Even 56 percent of Democrats call the 15,000 pages of regulations “ way over the top , ” as do 71 percent of independents and 87 percent of Republicans .
As for the law itself , the poll asks people what they would do with it if there were an up-or-down vote today .
While a 54-percent majority would repeal the law , 41 percent would keep it in place . That ’ s mostly unchanged from two years ago , when 56 percent said they would cancel it and 39 percent wanted the law to remain ( January 2011 ) .
On the law itself views are divided along partisan lines . By a 48 percentage-point margin , most Democrats favor keeping Obamacare ( 72-24 percent ) , while Republicans favor repealing it by an even wider 77-point margin ( 87-10 percent ) .
Independents also favor repeal , but by a narrower 16-point margin ( 53-37 percent ) .
Voters give President Obama negative ratings on health care . By a 10-point margin , more disapprove ( 53 percent ) than approve ( 43 percent ) of his job performance . That ’ s the lowest rating he ’ s received on health care since his 13-point negative rating in December 2011 ( 42-55 percent ) .
Seven percent of voters say health care is the most important issue facing the country , which puts it well behind the economy ( 42 percent ) , the federal deficit ( 17 percent ) and terrorism ( 9 percent ) on the priority list . Health care still tops guns ( 5 percent ) , Social Security ( 5 percent ) , immigration ( 4 percent ) and foreign policy ( 1 percent ) .
These ███ health care poll results are based on landline and cell phone interviews with 1,009 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide . The poll was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research ( D ) and Shaw & Company Research ( R ) from April 20 - 22 . The full poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points .
Almost all voters -- 85 percent -- say it ’ s okay for adults to use medical marijuana if it is prescribed by a physician .
Still , there ’ s some doubt about its use : The poll , finds 30 percent of voters think people who smoke medical marijuana truly need it for medical purposes , while nearly half -- 47 percent -- think those people just want to smoke pot .
In general , voters are about evenly divided over legalizing marijuana : 46 percent of voters favor legalization , while 49 oppose . Democrats favor the legal route by 57-39 percent ; Republicans oppose it , 62-33 percent .
