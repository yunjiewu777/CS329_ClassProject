According to those in the elite salons of Washington , ObamaCare can not be repealed . The conventional wisdom on the cocktail circuit contends that once you mandate health insurance for millions , you can not unmandate it . This theoretical belief has become accepted in Washington as a dogmatic article of faith . And the Obamacrats and most of the press believe that repeating this mantra often enough will make it so .
Of course , many Beltway insiders claim that ObamaCare can not be repealed because they wish to preserve the financial windfalls the law has brought them .
From the Big Pharma CEO bragging about the “ rock-solid deal ” benefitting his industry , to the health insurers who have a captive audience of Americans now required to purchase their products , to the lobbyists seeking preferential treatment in regulations , ObamaCare has become big business to the K Street crowd . No wonder so many view repeal of the law as fantastical—it would take away their gravy train .
But even many conservative “ thinkers ” in Washington have given in to ObamaCare fatalism . They may not say so in public , but they fully believe that talk of the law ’ s repeal exists only in the land of unsophisticated rubes .
The country that won two world wars and put a man on the moon can not , it is believed , repeal a disastrous public policy . Says who ? Why not ?
I know a little bit about health care policy , having spent most of my adult life analyzing and implementing policy changes on the state and federal levels . And based on my decades of experience , the idea that ObamaCare can not be repealed defies both logic and real world justification , on multiple levels .
First , the fact that the federal government has by force of law and under pain of taxation forced millions to sign up does not constitute “ success ” or “ progress. ” In fact , I bet the administration could have raised their enrollment totals even higher if friendly IRS agents had paid personal visits to all Americans “ encouraging ” them to enroll .
The real “ progress ” thus far from ObamaCare ? Health care premiums have gone up , health care costs continue to escalate , and millions of consumers are losing their plans and finding that they may not be able to see their doctors any longer .
Let ’ s remember , too , that ObamaCare was sold on a series of deceptions – if you like your plan you can keep your plan , you can keep your doctor , and premiums will decrease on average $ 2,500 per year .
To pass ObamaCare in the first place , the American people were sold a bill of goods that would make even P.T . Barnum blush .
In one sense , the smart guys are correct . Conservatives do need to articulate alternatives to ObamaCare—because the American people need relief from premiums that continue to skyrocket .
The plan I endorsed last month would do just that—focus like a laser beam on reducing costs . The Congressional Budget Office previously analyzed many of the policies included in our plan , and concluded they could reduce premiums by thousands of dollars compared to ObamaCare ’ s surging costs .
Many families struggling with rising premiums and co-payments might believe that they will never see relief . But the notion that we can ’ t slow the growth of health spending is just as fanciful as the idea that ObamaCare can not be repealed . The only reason we can ’ t accomplish both objectives is political will—because Washington needs a Beltway-sized reality check .
Fortunately , there ’ s a big country out there . We don ’ t care what they think in Washington , and we are not willing to quit on the idea of America .
