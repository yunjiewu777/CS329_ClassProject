Visitors to the U.S. could be forced to provide cellphone contacts and social-media passwords and answer questions about their ideology , according to Trump administration officials , measures that could intrude into the lives of millions of foreigners .
The changes being considered could apply to visitors from America ’ s closest allies as well as other nations and include subjecting more visa applicants to intense security reviews . Together , they would amount to the “ extreme vetting ” President Donald Trump promised as a candidate to guard against possible terror attacks .
A review under way of vetting procedures , described by administration officials , aims to replace what the Trump administration sees as a presumption toward letting people into the country with a more skeptical outlook .
“ If there is any doubt about a person ’ s intentions coming to the United States , they should have to overcome—really and truly prove to our satisfaction—that they are coming for legitimate reasons , ” said Gene Hamilton , senior counselor to the Department of Homeland Security .
Their full scope has yet to be publicly discussed and would be sure to generate significant controversy , both at home , from civil libertarians and others who see the questions as infringing on privacy rights , and abroad , as other nations could impose retaliatory requirements on Americans seeking visas .
The subject will likely be aired on Capitol Hill on Wednesday when Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly appears before a Senate committee . A spokesman for Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri , the top Democrat on the panel , said she planned to raise the issue .
“ Sen . McCaskill is deeply concerned about the vetting procedures and how they might be applied , ” he said .
The review was called for in an executive order Mr. Trump signed last month banning travel from six majority-Muslim countries , which he said was needed to guard against terrorism . The order also directed security officials to implement a vetting program that allows for a “ rigorous evaluation ” of whether applicants support terrorism or present a risk of causing harm .
While much of the order was put on hold by a federal judge in Hawaii , the work to enhance vetting procedures was allowed to proceed .
It was unclear when the review would be completed or translated into policy . Former Obama administration officials say the changes could be implemented using executive authority , though it is unclear whether formal rule-making would be needed or even desired . Either way , they could be challenged in court or by lawmakers in Congress .
A coalition of about 50 civil liberties and other groups issued a statement after Mr. Kelly testified at a congressional hearing in February about requiring passwords , saying it amounts to “ a direct assault on fundamental rights , ” including freedom of expression .
They also complained that the policy could be mirrored by foreign governments demanding passwords from Americans .
Homeland Security officials say the agency is planning to significantly increase demands for information from all visa applicants , including visitors and others seeking to immigrate . That might also include asking for financial information , as well as telephone contacts , one senior DHS official said .
The changes might even apply to visitors from the 38 countries that participate in the Visa Waiver Program , which requires adherence to strict U.S. standards in data sharing , passport control and other factors , one senior official said . That includes some longstanding U.S. allies , such as the U.K. , Japan and Australia .
The biggest change to U.S. policy would be asking applicants to hand over their cellphones so that officials could examine their stored contacts and perhaps other information . Visitors have had their phones examined at ports of entry , but a phone review isn ’ t routinely requested during the application stage .
The goal is to “ figure out who you are communicating with , ” the senior DHS official said . “ What you can get on the average person ’ s phone can be invaluable . ”
A second change would ask applicants for their social-media handles and passwords so that officials could see information posted privately in addition to public posts . Homeland Security has already experimented with asking for people ’ s handles so they can read public posts , but not those restricted to friends .
“ We want to say for instance , ‘ What sites do you visit ? And give us your passwords , ’ so that we can see what they do on the internet , ” Mr. Kelly said at the February hearing . “ If they don ’ t want to give us that information then they don ’ t come . ”
Former department officials who worked on security vetting during former President Barack Obama ’ s administration said that the information gleaned from telephones and social media could be helpful in assessing threats posed by applicants , but they said there are downsides , too . The effort would be time-consuming , they said , and it could drive people with bad intentions to change their practices .
“ The real bad guys will get rid of their phones , ” said Leon Rodriguez , who until January headed the U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services , a DHS agency , and was deeply involved in refugee screening . “ They ’ ll show up with a clean phone . ”
Still , one former Obama administration official said , telephone contacts could be particularly helpful in identifying terrorist ties , as their phone numbers could be run against various U.S. databases .
Already , the State Department has taken small steps toward tighter vetting , according to cables sent from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to embassies and consulates .
In them , he orders officials to identify “ applicant populations ” that warrant additional scrutiny , according to documents posted by Reuters in March . The department hasn ’ t disputed their contents . He also directs offices to limit the number of interviews scheduled each day to ensure each application is properly scrutinized .
Mr. Tillerson instructed officials to ask visa applicants additional questions , such as listing all email addresses and social-media handles used in the past five years , as well as the applicant ’ s travel history , employers and addresses over the past 15 years . But after the federal court put the travel ban on hold , Mr. Tillerson said in another message that to be cautious , those instructions should be put on hold as well .
The administration is also working to implement an idea first raised by Mr. Trump as a presidential candidate last August for an “ ideological test ” for people coming to the U.S. , the senior DHS official working on the review said . Such tests have been used before—for instance , to screen out anarchists , or members of the Communist Party .
“ Those who do not believe in our Constitution , or who support bigotry and hatred , will not be admitted for immigration into the country , ” Mr. Trump said in an August speech .
The DHS official said the types of questions under consideration now include how visa applicants view the treatment of women in society , whether they value the “ sanctity of human life ” and who they view as a legitimate target in a military operation .
The goal , he said , isn ’ t to filter out people with contrary thoughts but people who might act on them . That notion draws criticism from civil libertarians .
“ Our views and beliefs and opinions are protected , ” said Hugh Handeyside , a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties ’ s national security project . “ Those same principles should drive our decisions about whether people would be permitted to visit the United States . ”
