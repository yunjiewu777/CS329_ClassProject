John Cornyn and Mitch McConnell , ready to bring down the hammer
The suspicion that Mitch McConnell is going to follow the route to Trumpcare that Paul Ryan took—maximum secrecy and pressure on his members—is growing . The effort is facing serious obstacles and McConnell himself said he does n't know `` how we get to 50 [ votes ] at the moment '' just before the Memorial Day recess .
All the public statements from Republican senators have been reflecting that they are working through this , trying to reach consensus . But it looks like behind the scenes , McConnell is pushing hard , even though supposedly there 's not even a draft of a bill yet .
Some Senate Republicans hope to send their bill to the Congressional Budget Office by week ’ s end , allowing the nonpartisan CBO to begin work on estimating the bill ’ s cost and coverage details . Republicans ’ goal is to vote on the legislation before July 4 , according to a person familiar with the discussion . Senate Republicans have said their bill will diverge from a House-passed health bill , which would strike down much of the 2010 health law , often called Obamacare , and replace it with a new system of tax credits tied largely to age . The House bill would also cut $ 834 billion from Medicaid over a decade , a reduction that many Senate Republicans have said they can not support . One of the fiercest debates amid Senate Republicans is how to shape their own overhaul of Medicaid , the federal-state health program for the poor and disabled . The House bill would freeze funding for the ACA Medicaid expansion in 2020 , gradually winding down the program in the 31 states that expanded eligibility . Some Republican senators involved in the negotiations are considering pushing that deadline out further .
No draft yet , but they think they can have something to send to the CBO by Friday of this week ? That does n't add up .
