UPDATE : President Trump had a message for Rep. Massie too .
Looks like a third rate Grandstander named @ RepThomasMassie , a Congressman from , unfortunately , a truly GREAT State , Kentucky , wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress . He just wants the publicity . He can ’ t stop it , only delay , which is both dangerous ...... — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) March 27 , 2020
... & costly . Workers & small businesses need money now in order to survive . Virus wasn ’ t their fault . It is “ HELL ” dealing with the Dems , had to give up some stupid things in order to get the “ big picture ” done . 90 % GREAT ! WIN BACK HOUSE , but throw Massie out of Republican Party ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) March 27 , 2020
Rep. Ruben Gallego ( D-AZ ) was none too pleased with his colleague Thomas Massie ( R-KY ) for threatening to demand a recorded vote on the $ 2 trillion coronavirus relief bill on Friday . Because that meant he had to hop on a red eye flight last night and race back to Washington . The vote could fail if at least 216 members don ’ t show up to vote on the floor . Gallego `` thanked '' the Kentucky Republican right before he hopped on the plane .
I am jumping on the red eye tonight ... thanks Massie . # coronavirus https : //t.co/gkhaciDmPr — Ruben Gallego ( @ RubenGallego ) March 27 , 2020
Dear @ RepThomasMassie : If you intend to delay passage of the # coronavirus relief bill tomorrow morning , please advise your 428 colleagues RIGHT NOW so we can book flights and expend ~ $ 200,000 in taxpayer money to counter your principled but terribly misguided stunt . # thankyou — Rep. Dean Phillips ( @ RepDeanPhillips ) March 26 , 2020
`` Taking a red eye tonight , '' Rep. Gil Cisneros ( D-CA ) added . `` The American people , small businesses , and our healthcare workers need relief now . ''
The relief bill , Phase Three of Congress 's coronavirus relief effort , passed the Senate on Thursday by a vote of 96-0 , a pretty astounding accomplishment after several days of contentious debate . Much of the disagreement was regarding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's liberal wish list . The speaker came back to Washington last Sunday to demand new environmental measures be added into the bill , as well as millions of dollars in funding for D.C. 's John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts . The bill was supposed to be centered on targeted relief for individuals and businesses in financial straits because of the coronavirus outbreak .
The House is currently in session debating the relief bill .
