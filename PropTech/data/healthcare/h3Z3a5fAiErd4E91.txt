With a Democratic Congress , Obama passed ACA . But it caused all-out political war . Obama 's price of victory
Twenty years ago , when he was trying to persuade Bill and Hillary Clinton that universal health care was a politically unrealistic goal , the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan repeated one insistent warning : Sweeping , historic laws don ’ t pass barely . “ They pass 70-to-30 , ’ ’ he said , “ or they fail . ”
Four years ago , when he was trying to persuade Barack Obama that he would pay a terrible price for jamming health care reform through a reluctant Congress on a partisan vote , White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel begged his boss to settle for a vastly scaled-down plan .
We now know what happened : Obama ’ s bill made history — and caused all-out political war . For this president , that ’ s the price of doing business in a hyperpartisan culture . No one in Washington can really pretend the game is any longer on the level : Over the past few years , the Supreme Court stepped in to settle a presidential election by a 5-4 partisan vote , Obama ’ s predecessor launched a reckless war in Iraq on specious grounds , and a Republican-led House held the attorney general in contempt for the first time .
But the truth is that Moynihan ’ s point about the only way to make big changes work seems more than vindicated .
Obama tried — for far longer than most of his liberal allies wanted — to get a bipartisan health care bill . Its centerpiece — an individual mandate to buy insurance — was a Republican idea , first pushed in Congress 20 years ago by Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island . That meant nothing to the current Republican congressional leadership , which vowed to block Obama ’ s bill from the start . “ If we ’ re able to stop Obama on this , it will be his Waterloo , ” said then-Sen. Jim DeMint ( R-S.C. ) , now president of The Heritage Foundation . “ It will break him . ”
Obama might have shown greater legislative or political finesse at any one of several points along the way . But his basic alternative to passing the bill the way he did would have been to accept his lot as another liberal loser and abandon hope for 20 more years .
So the president has fair ground for accusing the House GOP of shutting down the government “ over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health insurance to millions of Americans , ” as he did on Tuesday . But he could have predicted that his own crusade to bring them coverage would unleash the political whirlwind that is now likely to last for years to come — whatever the merits of his cause . And Republicans are doing their best to make sure no one forgets that he rammed through the health law with Democratic support alone .
“ You reap what you sow , ” said Whit Ayres , the veteran Republican pollster . “ When you force through a major and very significant change to our economy , and you do it on a pure party-line vote , and at the very end change the rules to cram it through , you simply set up a long-term political battle that will never end . ”
Robert Blendon , a health policy expert at the Harvard School of Public Health , offered a less partisan but equally pungent analysis . “ The long-term future of bills that have absolutely no minority support and are not popular when passed is not good , ” he said . “ This law is vulnerable not just for this week , but for the 2014 elections , and if not then , for whenever the minority party does become the majority . ”
Yes , the Affordable Care Act was duly passed by both houses of Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court . Yet even the Volstead Act — which implemented Prohibition under the 18th Amendment — passed the House 287-100 and the Senate on a voice vote in 1919 , but was ignored by many governors and mayors , was never accepted by broad segments of the country and was repealed just 14 years later .
The Supreme Court may have ruled 6-3 in Roe v. Wade , but big chunks of the nation ’ s legislative and political culture were rocked back by the decision ’ s sweep , and have spent the last 40 years waging a dogged rear-guard action against it . The Court ’ s decision in Brown v. Board of Education was unanimous , but not until 10 years later , with the overwhelming bipartisan passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act , did that ruling really become the law of the land .
No major law of the 20th century — not Medicare , nor the 1957 , 1964 and 1965 civil rights and voting rights acts , nor the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act nor Social Security — passed the Congress by anything like the narrow , partisan margin of Obamacare . The Senate approved that 60-39 — a virtual squeaker by that chamber ’ s modern standards — and the House by just seven votes , 219-212 .
Perhaps only the progressive income tax , which the Senate approved by a vote of 44-37 in 1913 , had such a narrow margin of support . And , not coincidentally , it is the one measure among all those landmark laws that remains the subject of the liveliest debate a century later .
For Obama , these historical examples were quaint relics in dealing with a Congress that studies show is more divided than at any time since Reconstruction . His effective response to the realities he faces : What should I do ? Give up ? He famously told Emanuel , in a dig at Bill Clinton ’ s small-bore 1990s initiatives , that he had not come to Washington to “ do school uniforms . ”
