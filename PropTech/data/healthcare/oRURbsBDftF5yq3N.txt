“ If there ’ s no return on your investment , ” he said , “ there ’ s not really a point anymore . I put in 70 , 75 hours a week . Is it really worth it ? ”
Restaurant owners have been among the most vocal critics of the employer mandate , saying it could hurt them more than other businesses in part because their profit margins tend to be low . Some have said they will lay off workers or shift more of them to part-time status to avoid having to comply .
Mr. King thinks his current system is fair — he offers insurance to his most valuable employees , who are also the most likely to stick around — and points to low turnover as evidence that his uninsured servers , busboys , dishwashers , line cooks and hosts are content . Most are young and in good health .
He said “ not a soul ” among the employees at Shanty Grille had asked him to comply with the mandate .
“ Most of my servers are 25 to 30 years old , ” he said . “ They ’ d rather take the $ 200 a month and put it in a bar bill as opposed to insurance . ”
Yet at least one of Mr. King ’ s young , uninsured employees is anxious about not having medical coverage — so much that this week , he is starting a second job that comes with health benefits . The employee , Vince Ritter , a bartender , started working at Shanty Grille a decade ago , when he was 16 . The health care law allowed him to be covered under his parents ’ insurance plan for the last few years . But next week , when he turns 26 , he will by law lose that coverage .
That makes him nervous , he said , because he plays sports and has seen uninsured friends — including a colleague at Shanty Grille who tore a knee ligament on the basketball court — have to pay thousands of dollars for urgent care .
