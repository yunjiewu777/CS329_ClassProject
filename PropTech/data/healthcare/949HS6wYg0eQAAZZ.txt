A separate and unequal system People with mental illness face legal discrimination
Stigma against the mentally ill is so powerful that it 's been codified for 50 years into federal law , and few outside the mental health system even realize it .
This systemic discrimination , embedded in Medicaid and Medicare laws , has accelerated the emptying of state psychiatric hospitals , leaving many of the sickest and most vulnerable patients with nowhere to turn .
Advocates and experts who spoke with ███ describe a system in shambles , starved of funding while neglecting millions of people across the country each year .
The failure to provide treatment and supportive services to people with mental illness – both in the community and in hospitals – has overburdened emergency rooms , crowded state and local jails and left untreated patients to fend for themselves on city streets , says Patrick Kennedy , a former congressman from Rhode Island who has fought to provide better care for the mentally ill .
The USA routinely fails to provide the most basic services for people with mental illness -- something the country would never tolerate for patients with cancer or other physical disorders , Kennedy says .
Former congressman Patrick Kennedy : `` We have a wasteland of people who have died and been disabled because of inadequate care . ''
`` Mental health is a separate but unequal system , '' Kennedy says . `` We have a wasteland of people who have died and been disabled because of inadequate care . ''
Although most people with mental illness are not violent , the USA 's dysfunctional , long-neglected mental health system is under a microscope because of mass shootings in which the perpetrators had serious psychiatric problems . In a series of stories in the coming months , ███ will explore the human and financial costs that the country pays for not caring more about the nearly 10 million Americans with serious mental illness .
Stigma , a common thread in this series , forces many to live in shame rather than seek support , even as their lives unravel . Yet patients who want help often ca n't find it , says Kennedy , who has acknowledged his own struggles with bipolar disorder and drug addiction .
“ 'There is no other area of medicine where the government is the source of the stigma . ' ” Rep. Tim Murphy , R-Pa .
Stigma even shaped the crafting of the Medicaid law a half-century ago , because Congress did n't want to `` waste '' federal money on mental illness , says Ron Manderscheid , executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health & Disability Development Directors . `` People were operating under the belief that mental health was a black hole for money , '' Manderscheid says .
An obscure provision of the Medicaid law specifies that funds may be used for hospitals treating physical conditions but generally not for mental health , says Tim Murphy , R-Pa. , a child psychologist who has introduced legislation to ease these restrictions .
The Medicare law discriminates against those with mental illness , as well , by limiting the number of days that patients can receive inpatient psychiatric care . Medicare imposes no such limits for physical health , says Mark Covall , president and CEO of the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems .
By denying hospital care to the mentally ill , Murphy says Congress set two standards for health , effectively telling the country that the mentally ill are less deserving of a decent life than others . By forcing the mentally ill to live with sickness , confusion and disability , federal law reinforces the assumption that the mentally ill are incapable of leading functioning , safe , successful lives .
`` The federal government has set so many barriers to getting care , which they have done with no other type of illness , and it is wrong , '' Murphy says . `` There is no other area of medicine where the government is the source of the stigma . ''
Without federal support , states have n't been able to afford to keep their psychiatric hospitals open . States closed 10 % of their hospital beds from 2009 to 2012 , says Robert Glover , executive director of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors .
Private hospitals have reduced their psychiatric beds , as well , because Medicare and Medicaid typically pay less for inpatient mental healthcare than for medical care , says Ron Honberg , national director of policy and legal affairs at NAMI , the National Alliance on Mental Illness .
`` It 's just pure discrimination , '' Covall says . `` It 's penalizing the poor and disabled . ''
Mental health advocates have had more success reforming the private insurance system .
The Affordable Care Act , for example , requires that health exchanges provide equal mental and physical health coverage .
While in Congress , Kennedy led the fight to require private insurers to provide equal coverage for physical and mental health , resulting in a 2008 `` parity '' law that applies to policies issued after July 1 . Kennedy has joined in lawsuits against insurance companies to force them to comply .
“ 'If I have diabetes , there is no stigma to that . But if my brain does n't work , why am I supposed to be ashamed of that ? ' ” Pastor Rick Warren
Pastor Rick Warren , a best-selling author , could n't get long-term care for his son , Matthew , who suffered from depression for many years .
Although Medicare has corrected some of its unequal payments in recent years , it is n't affected by the parity law , Kennedy says .
The federal government has n't yet issued rules governing how the parity law affects Medicaid , the largest provider of mental health services in the country .
Pastor Rick Warren , a best-selling author , struggled to find long-term care for his son , Matthew , who suffered from depression for many years . `` At one point , we were counseled that Matthew needed extended , long-term help in a long-term care facility , '' Warren told ███ . `` When we began to look for one , we could n't find one . ''
Warren , founder of Saddleback Community Church in Orange County , Calif. , began speaking out about mental illness after Matthew killed himself last year , at age 27 . Warren compares the stigma of mental illness to that of AIDS and HIV . In both cases , people are blamed for bringing suffering upon themselves , he says .
`` If I have diabetes , there is no stigma to that , '' says Warren , who is making mental health one of his key ministries . `` But if my brain does n't work , why am I supposed to be ashamed of that ? It 's just another organ . People will readily admit to taking medicine for high blood pressure , but if I am taking medication for some kind of mental problem I 'm having , I 'm supposed to hide that . ''
Lost in darkness Many wait nearly a decade for treatment
Tracy Love suffered from depression and PTSD for 20 years before a jail psychiatrist properly diagnosed her .
Tracy Love suffered from mental illness for 20 years before getting help .
The delay led to frequent panic attacks , drinking and drug use , abusive relationships , three suicide attempts and a felony conviction .
After Love 's first suicide attempt 30 years ago , her parents told her to `` stop feeling sorry for yourself and snap out of it , '' she says .
`` It was only after I started to get better that I came to find out there is mental illness in my family , '' says Love , 52 , who lives near Rochester , N.Y. `` Nobody ever talked about it . ''
“ 'If someone had listened to me the way that psychiatrist listened to me in jail . I think maybe my illness would n't have gotten that far . ' ” Tracy Love
Doctors failed to diagnose Love 's mental illness , even after that suicide attempt sent her to the hospital . She finally found help in the unlikeliest of places — jail — where Love was incarcerated after stabbing an abusive boyfriend .
A jail psychiatrist , who interviewed her after the arrest , was the first person to diagnose her with major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder , says Love , who credits that doctor with changing her life . The incident cost Love dearly . She lost her job and custody of her 10-year-old son for three years . Although Love has turned her life around and works on a contract basis in mental health , she says her felony record has kept her from finding a permanent job .
`` If someone had listened to me the way that psychiatrist listened to me in jail , '' Love says , `` I think maybe my illness would n't have gotten that far . ''
CLOSE Tracy Love knew her whole life that something was wrong , but she didn ’ t get the help she needed until she went to jail .
On average , people with mental illness wait nearly a decade to get treatment after symptoms first appear , according to the National Institute of Mental Health .
Nearly 40 % of adults with serious mental illness received no treatment in the previous year , according to the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health , produced by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration . Among adults with any mental illness , 60 % were untreated . Though some people with mental illness do n't realize they 're sick , others simply ca n't find help .
It 's common for mentally ill patients — who go to the hospital in search of treatment for a psychiatric crisis — to languish for weeks in emergency rooms , says Robert Pierattini , a professor at the University of Vermont College of Medicine and chair of psychiatry at Fletcher-Allen Healthcare in Burlington .
In November , the son of Virginia state Sen. Creigh Deeds , a former gubernatorial candidate , was released from an emergency room because staff there could n't find a psychiatric bed . Hours later , he stabbed his father , then fatally shot himself . The senator survived and has become an advocate for changing mental health laws .
`` If this were cancer , we 'd be talking about giving patients the very best treatments , '' Pierattini says . In mental health , `` a peculiarity in the funding formula is deciding how we treat patients . ''
Funding is so poor and services are so hard to find that many patients can get help only after they 've become psychotic , Manderscheid says .
That 's akin to treating diabetes only after someone needs a leg amputated , Kennedy says .
Keris Myrick , who has schizoaffective disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder , says she has experienced the problem firsthand .
Myrick is the former CEO of a non-profit group that tries to bridge these gaps by providing overnight crisis care to patients who need urgent help . These programs are few and far between .
`` You go to a hospital and say , ' I 'm on the verge of a breakdown . ' The hospital will say , 'You 're not sick enough , ' '' says Myrick , former president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness `` I said , 'What do you mean I 'm not sick enough ? I 'm trying not to get sick . ' ''
Some say the designers of the Medicaid and Medicare rules had good intentions .
Congress did n't want to pay for long hospitalizations for psychiatric patients because the goal was to move people out of big asylums and into communities , Kennedy says .
Others note that the rules serve a useful purpose today because they encourage states to focus on outpatient treatment . `` They create incentives for states to serve people where they ought to be served , '' says Dennis Jones , the former mental health commissioner for Indiana and Texas .
In 1963 , Kennedy 's uncle , President John F. Kennedy , signed legislation to create a network of community mental health centers across the country .
“ 'Every parent I know has to fight for treatment for their child . ' ” Laura Pogliano
But the nation never followed through , Manderscheid says . While many of the old hospitals have closed , the country built fewer than half of the planned 1,500 mental health centers . Hospital beds , meanwhile , have shrunk from a peak of more than 500,000 in the 1950s to just over 100,000 today .
`` It 's an unfulfilled promise , '' Glover says . `` There needs to be a balance of community based-services and inpatient care . ''
Over the decades , Congress has relaxed Medicaid 's policies somewhat , Honberg says . In the 1970s , Medicaid began paying for psychiatric hospitalizations for patients under 21 . In the 1980s , it began paying for psychiatric hospitals with fewer than 16 beds .
But Congress is unlikely to completely eliminate the unequal Medicaid rules , Glover says . Paying for unlimited inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations would likely add several billion dollars to the Medicaid budget — a non-starter for many in Congress , he says .
But the Affordable Care Act is paying for a pilot study of what happens when Medicaid further relaxes its payment rules .
The $ 75 million study provides 11 states and the District of Columbia with federal Medicaid matching funds for people who need emergency inpatient psychiatric care . Some states offer additional services . Early results from the national pilot study , released in December , show that patients had relatively short hospital stays — an average of eight days — with few needing to be rehospitalized within the same year .
CLOSE By denying hospital care to the mentally ill , Rep. Tim Murphy says Congress effectively tells the mentally ill they are less deserving of a decent life than others .
Murphy 's bill also aims to help more people get short-term inpatient care .
His Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act would allow states to receive Medicaid matching payments for adult psychiatric hospitalizations , Murphy says . The bill has won support from a number of medical and mental health organizations , including the American Psychiatric Association , the American College of Emergency Physicians and the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems .
Rep. Ron Barber , D-Ariz. , also has introduced legislation to expand hospital care . His bill would eliminate Medicare 's 190-day lifetime limit on psychiatric hospital care .
`` It 's a gaping hole we 've got to fill , '' Barber says .
Yet at a time when Congress is deeply divided -- and members are preparing for an election -- mental health advocates say the bills face an uphill battle . Even if the bills do n't pass as written , Manderscheid says he hopes Congress will craft a compromise to make some progress in providing care .
Laura Pogliano of Towson , Md . has often paid out-of-pocket for the care of 22-year-old son , who has schizophrenia . He frequently has needed care that was n't covered by insurance . Other times , he could n't wait for a public hospital bed to open up .
In less than three years , Pogliano says , she exhausted all $ 250,000 of her life savings . She lost her house when she chose to pay his hospital bills instead of her mortgage payments . `` Every parent I know , '' she says , `` has to fight for treatment for their child . ''
Some people with mental illness are fighting against stigma in surprising ways .
Canadian David Granirer , a comedian who has long suffered from depression , teaches people with mental illness to speak out through comedy . He calls his class Stand Up for Mental Health .
In the past decade , Granirer has taught comedy to 400 adults with mental illness throughout North America , both as therapy for them , as well as a way to debunk stereotypes of the mentally ill .
`` How often do you hear the words 'hilarious ' and 'schizophrenic ' in the same sentence ? '' asks Granirer . `` Audiences see people with labels like bipolar and schizophrenic , and see them as funny and likable and courageous . ''
Jessica Dawson was diagnosed with schizophrenia . She recently participated in Stand Up for Mental Health , a program that teaches people with mental illness to perform stand up comedy routines .
Granirer says one of his most courageous students has been Jessica Dawson .
She was laughed at too much as a child . For much of her life , laughter sounded like mockery , and jokes felt like stones thrown by bullies . For Dawson -- who was suicidal by age 10 , had a baby at 16 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia at 22 -- there often was n't a lot to smile about . Dawson 's parents and doctor hid her diagnosis from her for four years , afraid that the news would prove too upsetting .
Yet in 2006 , Dawson found herself on stage , telling jokes , and getting laughs , while talking about the most painful episodes in her life – ones about which she had always been ashamed -- such as hearing voices and undergoing treatment with electroconvulsive therapy .
`` Before I had electroshock , I thought I was Jesus Christ , '' she quipped in her act . `` Afterward , I thought I was a toaster . ''
Learning to see her life in a new light proved to be powerfully healing , Dawson says .
`` It changed my life , '' says Dawson , who lives in Canada 's British Columbia . `` Having the fantasy of being a star sort of lifts you momentarily out of thinking about how low you are on the societal scale of acceptance . . . I 'm no longer buying into the shame , and I 'm giving others permission not to buy into the shame . ''
While standup comedy is n't for everyone , the program provides an important service , Granirer says , by allowing people to see that people with mental illness are n't that different .
CLOSE People with mental illness speak out through standup comedy .
With so many people with mental illness `` in the closet , '' the dominant image of people with mental illness has often been negative – the homeless person on the street , the deranged young man with a gun , says Patrick Corrigan , a professor of psychology at Illinois Institute of Technology .
Research shows that the most promising way to dispel stereotypes is to meet someone with mental illness face-to-face , Corrigan says . These sorts of encounters are two to three times as effective as educational programs .
`` The way we 've diminished the stigma of being gay is by having brave men and women come out , '' Corrigan says . `` It was n't watching anti-stigma programs in middle school . ''
Few public figures with mental illness today speak about it openly .
Football player Brandon Marshall , a wide receiver for the Chicago Bears , is an exception . Marshall , 30 , was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder , which can cause mood swings and emotional outbursts , in 2010 .
Chicago Bears wide receiver Brandon Marshall was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder , which can cause mood swings and emotional outbursts , in 2010 .
Marshall says he decided to speak up to help dispel the stigma around mental illness .
`` So many people are trying to hide something that needs to be talked about , and if it 's talked about , so many lives will be saved , '' says Marshall , who created the Brandon Marshall Foundation to help others with mental illness . `` Where we are at is where the cancer community and HIV community were 25 years ago . ''
While Marshall says he has taken some flack for speaking out -- including trash talk on the football field -- he says the positive responses have outnumbered the negative .
“ 'Where we are at is where the cancer community and HIV community were 25 years ago . ' ” NFL player Brandon Marshall
`` The good part has been having a platform to help people , '' Marshall says . `` One out of four of us are suffering from something . ''
Marshall says learning from other people with mental illness has given him hope . `` You can get better , '' Marshall says . `` There is light at the end of the tunnel . ''
Hakeem Rahim , who has bipolar disorder , once felt he had to hide his condition , which surfaced when he was a freshman at Harvard University . Instead of calling in sick when he was having a tough day emotionally , he would tell his employer that he had the flu . Eventually , he just did n't feel comfortable hiding his diagnosis .
Rahim now works full-time giving educational talks , mostly about mental illness . A woman called him after seeing him speak at a college , confiding that she was suicidal . Rahim , 33 , was able to find her help .
`` These stories are so important , '' says Rahim , who says that surveys conducted after his talks suggest that audience members were more willing to talk to others if they felt depressed or anxious . `` Part of my goal is to share what I learned . Hopefully , if they learn it earlier , they can get help sooner . ''
CLOSE Hakeem Rahim hid his bipolar disorder for years before finally sharing his diagnosis . He now works full-time giving educational talks , mostly about mental illness .
Research suggests the country has made fitful progress in fighting stigma .
Large national surveys conducted in 1996 and 2006 found that Americans increasingly understand mental illness to be a biological condition , rather than a moral failing . And the study found Americans have become more accepting of people with depression .
Over the same period , however , Americans grew less willing over time to befriend or work with someone with schizophrenia , and more inclined to see people with the disease as violent and dangerous . Researchers have not conducted more recent surveys .
It 's likely that Americans ' attitudes toward serious mental illness have only hardened since the shootings at Virginia Tech , Newtown , Conn. and Santa Barbara , Calif. , says psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey , founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center , which focuses on patients with severe mental illness .
A 2012 study found doctors less likely to prescribe medications for heart disease and other ailments to people with mental illness . Other studies have found that doctors are less likely to recommend surgery after a heart attack for people with mental illness , or hospitalize them after an emergency department visit for diabetes .
Dawson says she no longer feels the need to hide her diagnosis .
At one time , she was afraid to even ride the bus , because she worried that other passengers could tell she had schizophrenia . After taking the stand-up class , she learned to joke with people on the bus , defusing her fears .
Dawson says she wishes that story had a happier ending . She 's largely home-bound today , unable to take public transportation or even leave the house , due to rheumatoid arthritis that makes it difficult to walk . Although she has a wheelchair , her apartment complex wo n't allow her to install a ramp . Dawson says ca n't afford to move to a more accessible apartment .
Yet Dawson says she remains forever changed by her experience onstage , which gave her the confidence to write to local politicians about important issues , take college classes for the first time and respond to online bullies who make fun of those with mental illness .
As for her childhood tormentors , Dawson says , `` All those people who said I had no sense of humor ? They were wrong . ''
