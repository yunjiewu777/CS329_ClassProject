Immigrant-rights advocates scrambled Friday to plead with House Speaker John A. Boehner to bring an immigration legalization bill to the floor before he leaves office next month , fearing his replacement will show even more antipathy toward their agenda .
Mr. Boehner had long been pressing his party to tackle immigration , and in the days after President Obama ’ s 2012 re-election the Ohio Republican set one major goal : The House would pass a bill to legalize those in the country without authorization .
But House GOP conservatives threatened a revolt , and Mr. Boehner and his fellow leaders backed off , instead blaming President Obama for ruining chances for cooperation .
Now that he ’ s unshackled by the need to keep his own troops in line , immigration advocates said Mr. Boehner should try again , relying on Democrats to deliver the votes to pass a bill .
“ There is no reason not to have a vote , ” Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez , Illinois Democrat , said . “ He should call a vote on immigration reform , and I think in my heart that Speaker Boehner would stand with us , with his country , and with the immigrant and Latino community . ”
Such a move is unlikely , both because of the other issues Mr. Boehner will have to oversee between now and the end of October , when he will leave office , and because of continued opposition within the House GOP .
Indeed , Mr. Boehner ’ s perceived eagerness to work on immigration with Mr. Obama prodded some of the fiercest opposition within the House Republican Caucus , and some conservatives had said if Mr. Boehner had pursued a legalization bill he would have been tossed as speaker .
Speaking to reporters Friday afternoon , Mr. Boehner said nothing about his agenda would change .
“ I ’ m going to make the same decisions I would have made regardless of this , ” he said .
