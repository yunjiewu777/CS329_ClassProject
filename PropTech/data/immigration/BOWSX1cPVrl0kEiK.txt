Americans are feeling rather ambivalent about comprehensive immigration reform being the absolute priority issue for President Barack Obama and the U.S Congress this year . Instead , 91 percent of those surveyed in a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll believe job creation should take that spot .
If the president plans to hit replay on his 2013 State of the Union ( SOTU ) address in which the economy and job creation to help bolster the middle class were his main focus -- Obama called that the “ North Star ” guiding policymaking -- then his speech before Congress tonight should resonate with the public .
Only 39 percent believe passing immigration reform legislation should be of absolute priority . 42 percent say the issues can be delayed until next year . By comparison , only 4 percent believe creating jobs should be delayed a year , according to the poll . The poll comes as Obama is set to deliver the 2014 SOTU address to the nation Tuesday .
That should be good news to House Republicans , who have only passed a handful of immigration bills ( out of committee ) and are in no rush to get comprehensive immigration reform done . Republicans have opted for a piecemeal approach and are soon to release a set of broad principles on how to go about reforming the nation ’ s immigration system . Crucial to the debate though is what to do about the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the U.S. A bipartisan bill left the Senate last July , offering them a 13-year pathway to citizenship . When the GOP releases its principles , reports are that it could provide legal status rather than citizenship to those living here without legal papers .
The researchers surveyed 800 adults between Jan. 25 and Jan. 28 .
