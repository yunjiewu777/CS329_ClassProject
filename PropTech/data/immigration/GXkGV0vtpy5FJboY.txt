Thousands of Dreamers have used a loophole in federal law to get on a full pathway to citizenship , top congressional Republicans revealed Friday , citing government data withheld by the Obama administration but provided by the Trump administration .
The Dreamers were all part of DACA , the legally questionable amnesty program that ’ s under scrutiny right now as President Trump decides whether to scrap the Obama-era amnesty .
The House and Senate Judiciary Committees revealed that more than 45,000 DACA recipients were approved for “ advance parole , ” which is permission to leave and reenter the U.S. despite not being in permanent legal status here .
But under a quirk of law , those granted advance parole can then ask to adjust their status and gain legal residence — and eventually citizenship — as long as they have a qualifying relationship .
The Obama administration had seemed intent on keeping the data secret , refusing to answer requests from Congress . The Trump administration complied .
According to the data from U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services , as of Aug. 21 , 45,447 DACA recipients had been approved for advance parole .
The loophole is known among immigration activists , and public colleges in California were urged to use it to help their illegal immigrant students here under the DACA program to gain legal status .
The California-Mexico Studies Center actually advertises just such a program , charging thousands of dollars to give Dreamers a chance to travel south to Mexico to qualify for advance parole . Part of the fees the program collects help pay for “ legal advice and filing assistance ” in obtaining advance parole .
Another class of 35 students took advantage of the program earlier this month , visiting Mexico then returning back to the U.S. legally — and now able to petition for permanent legal status , if they have another qualifying relationship such as a citizen child or spouse .
