The Affordable Care Act , a k a Obamacare , goes fully into effect at the beginning of next year , and predictions of disaster are being heard far and wide . There will be an administrative “ train wreck , ” we ’ re told ; consumers will face a terrible shock . Republicans , one hears , are already counting on the law ’ s troubles to give them a big electoral advantage .
No doubt there will be problems , as there are with any large new government initiative , and in this case , we have the added complication that many Republican governors and legislators are doing all they can to sabotage reform . Yet important new evidence — especially from California , the law ’ s most important test case — suggests that the real Obamacare shock will be one of unexpected success .
Before I can explain what the news means , I need to make a crucial point : Obamacare is a deeply conservative reform , not in a political sense ( although it was originally a Republican proposal ) but in terms of leaving most people ’ s health care unaffected . Americans who receive health insurance from their employers , Medicare or Medicaid — which is to say , the vast majority of those who have any kind of health insurance at all — will see almost no changes when the law goes into effect .
There are , however , millions of Americans who don ’ t receive insurance either from their employers or from government programs . They can get insurance only by buying it on their own , and many of them are effectively shut out of that market . In some states , like California , insurers reject applicants with past medical problems . In others , like New York , insurers can ’ t reject applicants , and must offer similar coverage regardless of personal medical history ( “ community rating ” ) ; unfortunately , this leads to a situation in which premiums are very high because only those with current health problems sign up , while healthy people take the risk of going uninsured .
