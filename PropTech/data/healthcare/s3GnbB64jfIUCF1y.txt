Romney drew a standing ovation from the crowd when he repeated his promise . Mitt promises to repeal health law
ORLANDO , Fla. — Mitt Romney pledged Tuesday that no matter what the Supreme Court does about President Barack Obama ’ s health care law , he ’ ll still push for a repeal of the whole thing .
Romney ’ s remarks to supporters at Con-Air Industries , a heating and air conditioning filter factory , didn ’ t mark any change in his health care policies — but they did acknowledge that the upcoming Supreme Court ruling is what ’ s on everyone ’ s minds right now . The court ruling could come in the last week of June — just two weeks away .
Romney drew a sustained standing ovation from the crowd when he repeated his promise to grant waivers from “ Obamacare ” to all 50 states on the first day of his presidency .
“ You know , regardless of what they do , it ’ s going to be up to the next president whether to repeal or replace Obamacare , or to replace Obamacare . I intend to do both , ” Romney said , pretending to pull a copy of the Supreme Court decision out of his pocket .
“ If I ’ m the president at a time when the Supreme Court has left Obamacare in place , I will repeal it on Day One by sending out a waiver for all 50 states , ” Romney said . “ Now , if we 're able to repeal it , or if the Supreme Court is able to get that job done for us , we want to replace it .
Romney also said Obama “ needs to get in touch with what ’ s happening in the private sector , what 's happening with middle income families and the damage that 's being done by the specter of Obamacare and the taxes it already charges to businesses in the health care sector . ”
