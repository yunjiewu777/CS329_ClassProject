After failing to derail ObamaCare during the partial government shutdown , congressional Republicans have found new life in attacking President Obama ’ s signature health care law .
With Congress returning on Tuesday from the long holiday weekend , the battle shifts to a House Republican-backed bill that would allow Americans to keep their health plans .
The House Energy and Commerce Committee bill capitalizes on Obama ’ s apology last week for earlier mistakenly assuring the public that they could stay on their health insurance if they liked it .
A vote is scheduled for Friday and coincides with escalating attacks on the failed rollout last month of the ObamaCare website , which gave members in both chambers new lines of attack -- including the previously tricky strategy of trying to chip away at the law .
Although Democrats roundly opposed that approach during the shutdown stalemate , now some moderate Democrats have come around .
Republicans have attacked practically every aspect and person connected to the website failures -- from contractors who helped build the site to suggesting the site ’ s technical problems are just “ the tip of the iceberg . ”
The centerpiece of the attack has so far has been pressing Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius into testifying earlier this month before a House committee .
Energy committee Chairman Fred Upton now appears to have seized on the Obama apology asa way to garner Democratic support for chamber ’ s bill .
“ Actions speak louder than words , ” the Michigan Republican said . “ If the president is serious about offering relief to Americans whose health plans are being canceled , then he should strongly support the Keep Your Health Plan Act . … The president ought to embrace the bipartisan call for legislative action . ”
The Republican-controlled House has also proposed legislation to delay mandating that Americans get insurance , just as the president delayed the employer mandate , and to verify that low-income people getting federal subsidies to pay for the insurance indeed qualify for them .
Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Pitts , who earlier this year sponsored a failed attempt to rework ObamaCare , recently told The Hill that his colleagues “ regret ” that decision -- evidence Republicans are moving away from their do-or-die approach to the law .
Pitts told the newspaper that fellow House Republicans appear to be “ shifting toward targeted fixes , if you want to call it that . ”
Republicans strategists insist that harping on ObamaCare straight through the 2016 presidential election cycle is a winning strategy -- pointing to the recent Virginia governor ’ s race in which Republican nominee Ken Cuccinelli lost but managed to close a double-digit lead by hammering away at the law in the closing weeks of the campaign .
Some Democrats are also trying also trying to change the law -- particularly senators seeking re-election next year in conservative-leaning states .
Among them are Mark Begich , of Alaska , Mary Landrieu , of Louisiana , and Kay Hagan , of North Carolina , who are also facing conservative groups vowing to spend millions to show voters their early support for ObamaCare .
Landrieu , in fact , introduced a bill last week similar to the House one that would allow Americans to keep their existing health plans .
“ When we passed the Affordable Care Act , we did so with the intention that if you liked your health plan , you could keep it , ” she said . “ A promise was made and this legislation will ensure that this promise is kept . I have said repeatedly that the … act is n't perfect , and I am willing to work with anyone who wants to improve it and implement it correctly . ”
