RICHMOND , Va. — Stephanie Parris was finishing a two-year prison sentence for a probation violation when she heard she ’ d be going home three weeks early because of COVID-19 .
It made her feel bad to leave when she had so few days left at the Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women . She said she wasn ’ t sick , and , as far as she knew , there were no cases at the facility . There were others still inside who could have used the reprieve .
`` I would have helped someone who had nine or 10 months , someone who absolutely needed it , ” she said recently . “ There was a lady in there who was very elderly , and she has very bad health problems . I would have given my place to her . ”

There has been a major drop in the number of people behind bars in the U.S . Between March and June , more than 100,000 people were released from state and federal prisons , a decrease of 8 percent , according to a nationwide analysis by ███ and The Associated Press . The drops range from 2 percent in Virginia to 32 percent in Rhode Island . By comparison , the state and federal prison population decreased by 2.2 percent in all of 2019 , according to a report on prison populations by the Vera Institute of Justice .
But this year ’ s decrease has not come because of efforts to release vulnerable prisoners for health reasons and to manage the spread of the virus raging in prisons , according to detailed data from eight states compiled by ███ and AP . Instead , head counts have dropped largely because prisons stopped accepting new prisoners from county jails to avoid importing the virus , court closures meant fewer people were receiving sentences and parole officers sent fewer people back inside for low-level violations , according to data and experts . So the number could rise again once those wheels begin moving despite the virus .
In Virginia , about 250 prisoners were released as corrections officials scrambled to minimize the spread of the virus , accounting for less than half of the decrease in population in that state between March and June , the news organizations found .
COVID-19 impacts prison populations nationwide The number of people in state and federal prisons dropped from roughly 1.3 million in March to 1.2 million in June . The 8 percent decrease nationwide is largely due to prohibitions stopping new prisoners from being accepted from local jails , parole officers sending fewer people back to prison for low-level violations , and court closures due to coronavirus leading to fewer people being sentenced , experts said .

Source : Marshall Project and Associated Press analysis of state and federal prison agency data Alaska and Maryland did not provide data . In states with unified jail and prison systems—Connecticut , Vermont , Delaware , Hawaii and Rhode Island—pre-trial detainees are not included in population counts .
In California , Gov . Gavin Newsom last week ordered the release of up to 8,000 people by the end of August after a series of coronavirus outbreaks in the state ’ s prisons . Between mid-March and mid-June , California ’ s prison population dropped by more than 7,000 , less than half of which can be attributed to an earlier decision by the state to let vulnerable prisoners out early .
More than 57,000 prisoners have tested positive for the coronavirus in facilities across the country since the outbreak began . Of those , at least 34,000 have recovered , and at least 651 have died , the data showed . Over 12,400 infections have been reported among staff , including 46 deaths .
Experts and advocates said whether the public perceives a public safety threat from people who are released early because of COVID-19 is likely to affect the larger criminal justice reform movement , especially the push to decrease prison populations .
While many people may be qualified for early releases , very few actually got out . In April , Pennsylvania launched a temporary reprieve program , allowing the state ’ s corrections department to send people home under the condition that they return to finish their sentences once the pandemic passes . The governor ’ s office predicted more than 1,500 would be eligible for release .
So far , the state 's corrections department has recommended 1,200 people for reprieves , but the application process is slow and tedious , said Bret Bucklen , the department ’ s research director . Each application needs approval from the governor , the secretary of corrections and the assistant district attorney who oversaw the initial conviction .
Nearly three months later , fewer than 160 people have been released through the reprieve program , while Pennsylvania ’ s total prison population dropped by 2,800 .
As in Pennsylvania , data from states such as North Carolina , Illinois and New Jersey shows coronavirus releases only account for less than one-third of the decrease in prison population , which suggests something else is driving the drop . According to Martin Horn , professor emeritus at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former corrections commissioner for New York City , the pandemic has slowed the entire criminal justice system , which means fewer people are going to prisons .
Before the pandemic , parolees were required to meet with their parole officers in person . For the last four months , those meetings have mostly been by phone , and people on parole are under less scrutiny and less likely to be returned to prison for violating the rules right now , Horn said .
Even many who have been sentenced for crimes are not being transferred to state prisons . In North Carolina , the courts enacted a two-month moratorium on accepting newly sentenced individuals into prisons . By the time the moratorium was lifted in May , about 1,800 people were in county jails awaiting transfer to state prisons , said John Bull , a spokesman for North Carolina ’ s Department of Public Safety .
Whether prison populations rise once the pandemic eases will depend in part on how the public perceives people who are released early now , said Wanda Bertram , spokeswoman for the Prison Policy Initiative , a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on mass incarceration .
For example , if people leaving prison have little support and end up homeless , Bertram said she fears they may be more likely to get arrested for things like sleeping on the street , and the community may in turn associate early releases with more crime .
Garland King , who will turn 78 in a few weeks , spent 12 years in a North Carolina prison for shooting and killing his son-in-law during an argument . Like many older prisoners , he has mounting medical issues , including asthma and arthritis .
King was scheduled to be released in June , but on April 17 he became one of almost 500 prisoners who were let go early for good behavior . Since his wife died two years ago , he needed to find housing and apply for social services . He fretted over everything so much that he barely ate in the days leading to his freedom and nearly had a medical crisis as a result . He eventually found housing through a community health program in Durham , North Carolina .
Nazgol Ghandnoosh , a senior research analyst at the Sentencing Project , a group that advocates for sentencing reform , said that while the prison population decreases are a step in the right direction , she is disappointed by the numbers . Even if the COVID-19 release policies work as intended , they might not lower the prison population enough because states often exclude violent offenders from such releases , Ghandnoosh said .
“ Even though we are sending too many people to prison and keeping them there too long , and even though research shows people who are older have the highest risk from COVID-19 and the lowest risk of recidivism , we are still not letting them out , ” Ghandnoosh said .
