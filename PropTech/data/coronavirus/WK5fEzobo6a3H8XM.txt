President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Tuesday they ’ re strongly considering giving Americans $ 1,000 each within the next two weeks to help with the impact from the coronavirus .
“ We ’ re going big , ” Mr. Trump said at the White House .
Mr. Mnuchin , who was meeting later with Republican senators , said the administration is quickly coming around to the idea of cutting checks for every American who needs it .
“ We ’ re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately . Americans need cash now , ” Mr. Mnuchin said . “ I mean now in the next two weeks . ”
He said the details for qualifying still would need to be worked out with Congress .
“ We don ’ t need to send people who make a million dollars a year checks , ” Mr. Mnuchin said .
The president said he wants to “ do something that gets money to them as quickly as possible . ”
“ Obviously some people shouldn ’ t be getting checks with $ 1,000 , ” he said . “ We ’ ll have a pretty good idea by the end of the day how we ’ re going to do it . ”
The president has been pushing for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year , but he acknowledged on Tuesday that the impact of such relief would be felt more slowly .
“ Payroll tax is one way , but it does come over a period of months . We ’ re going big . It ’ s a substantial number , ” Mr. Trump said .
“ The president has instructed me we have to do this now , ” he said . “ This is no fault to American workers . For medical reasons , we are shutting down parts of the economy . ”
He added that other sectors of the economy need help too .
“ This is worse than 9/11 . For the airline industry , they ’ ve almost ground to a halt , ” he said .
There are roughly 155 million workers in the U.S . If every one of them got a check , the cost would be about $ 155 billion .
