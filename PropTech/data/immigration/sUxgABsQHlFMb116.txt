Grandparents and other relatives of people living in the US can not be barred from entering under President Trump 's travel ban , a judge has ruled .
The order , by District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii , is a fresh legal blow to Mr Trump 's immigration crackdown .
The judge said the ban had interpreted a Supreme Court ruling too narrowly .
That decision , made last month , partly reinstated the ban on refugees and travellers from six Muslim-majority countries .
It said only those with `` bona fide '' family ties would be let into the US .
But the Trump administration decided that did not include grandparents , grandchildren , brothers-in-law , sisters-in-law , uncles , aunts , nephews , nieces and cousins .
Judge Watson , however , disagreed - and ordered that those restrictions should not be enforced .
The judge condemned the government 's definition of a close relative as `` unduly restrictive '' .
`` Common sense , for instance , dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents . Indeed , grandparents are the epitome of close family members '' , he wrote .
US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement the federal district court had `` issued decisions that are entrusted to the Executive Branch , undermined national security , delayed necessary action , created confusion , and violated a proper respect for separation of powers '' .
He added the justice department would `` now reluctantly return directly to the Supreme Court to again vindicate the rule of law and the Executive Branch 's duty to protect the nation '' .
Judge Watson 's ruling has far-reaching consequences for the United States , and not just Hawaii .
He is one of about 700 judges in the district courts , which - despite the name - are part of the federal system , rather than local state courts . Their role is to interpret the law on federal issues using powers devolved to them by the Supreme Court .
The new ruling also offers hope to refugees who have a close relative already in the US , as they should now be able to enter - despite the fact that Mr Trump 's 50,000 cap on refugee admissions for the year was reached earlier in the week .
Another disputed issue was whether a refugee group agreeing to take someone in counted as the type of close connection needed to circumvent the travel ban .
But Judge Watson ruled that assurances from a resettlement agency were adequate .
`` An assurance from a United States refugee resettlement agency… is formal , it is a documented contract , it is binding… bona fide does not get any more bona fide than that , '' he wrote .
Hawaii 's attorney general , Douglas Chin , said the ruling meant the government could not ignore the `` scope '' of the Supreme Court decision `` as it sees fit '' .
`` Family members have been separated and real people have suffered enough . Courts have found that this Executive Order has no basis in stopping terrorism and is just a pretext for illegal and unconstitutional discrimination , '' he said .
Hawaii is continuing to prepare for the Supreme Court hearing later in the year , he added .
Mr Trump 's ban on travel to the US for people from Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen has been controversial since its announcement .
The Supreme Court is still considering the current version of the law , and allowed a temporary ban to come into effect in June pending their full judgement .
Mr Trump says the restrictions are needed to keep America safe and prevent terror attacks .
However , critics including states and refugee advocacy groups have said the ban discriminates against Muslims .
An initial version of the ban , published in January , sparked mass protests at airports and a series of legal challenges that prevented its implementation .
Mr Trump drafted a new version in March , dropping Iraq from the list of countries , clarifying the position of `` green card '' holders , removing priority for `` religious minorities '' in mostly-Muslim countries , and softening a tough stance on Syrian refugees .
But courts struck down the new version within days , with a Virginia court claiming it was `` rooted in religious animus '' toward Muslims .
That prompted the Trump administration to go to the Supreme Court for a ruling , where conservatives hold a majority of five to four .
The nation 's highest court allowed the ban to go ahead temporarily , until it makes a full decision in October .
