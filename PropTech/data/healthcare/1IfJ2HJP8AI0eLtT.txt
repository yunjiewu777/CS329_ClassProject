Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Monday put off Republican lawmakers who want to question her about the disastrous rollout of Obamacare this week , instead agreeing to testify about the program ’ s computer problems next week .
A spokeswoman for Mrs. Sebelius said she can not attend a House hearing Thursday due to a scheduling conflict . Late Monday , the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced she will appear before its members Oct. 30 .
The delay angered Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , who called it a “ refusal ” by Mrs. Sebelius to testify Thursday . He said the public deserves answers now about the burgeoning problems with the HealthCare.gov website .
“ The refusal of Secretary Sebelius to appear at this week ’ s hearing shows that this administration is still not prepared to be straight with the American people , ” Mr. Boehner said . “ Every day new questions about the president ’ s health care law arise , but candid explanations are nowhere to be found . ”
The speaker said Mrs. Sebelius ‘ decision “ continues a troubling pattern of this administration seeking to avoid accountability and stonewall the public . ”
“ What is more important to Secretary Sebelius than providing answers to the American people ? I hope President Obama has a greater appreciation for the role of oversight and orders his secretary to fully cooperate with all congressional inquiries , ” Mr. Boehner said .
White House press secretary Jay Carney said it ’ s up to Cabinet secretaries to decide when and how to cooperate with a congressional inquiry .
Mrs. Sebelius will be at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston on Wednesday night to speak about the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy signing the Community Mental Health Act . On Thursday , she ’ s scheduled to attend an event in Phoenix .
“ We have always indicated to the committee that she intended to testify but that she had a scheduling conflict , ” said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters .
Republicans have criticized Mrs. Sebelius for being more willing to appear on the “ Daily Show ” with Jon Stewart on Comedy Central to talk about Obamacare than she is to testify before Congress about the rollout ’ s failures .
The committee ’ s Republicans said that three health care contractors will testify Thursday , including representatives of website designer CGI .
“ We are now entering week four of the botched health care rollout , and with hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars spent for a system that still does not work , Congress and the American people deserve answers , ” said Rep. Fred Upton , Michigan Republican , the committee chairman . “ We were told repeatedly that implementation was ‘ on track , ’ and it is now time for all those responsible to explain what happened . ”
