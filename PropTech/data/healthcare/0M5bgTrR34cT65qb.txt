On a recent afternoon at his office in Hartford , Conn. , Dr. Doug Gerard examines a patient complaining of joint pain . He checks her out , asks her a few questions about her symptoms and then orders a few tests before sending her on her way .
For a typical quick visit like this , Gerard could get reimbursed $ 100 or more from a private insurer . For the same visit , Medicare pays less — about $ 80 . And now , with the new private plans under the Affordable Care Act , Gerard says he would get something in between , but closer to the lower Medicare rates .
`` I can not accept a plan [ in which ] potentially commercial-type reimbursement rates were now going to be reimbursed at Medicare rates . You have to maintain a certain mix in private practice between the low reimbursers and the high reimbursers to be able to keep the lights on , '' he says .
Three insurers offered plans on Connecticut 's ACA marketplace in 2014 and Gerard is only accepting one . He wo n't say which , but he will say it pays the highest rate .
`` I do n't think most physicians know what they 're being reimbursed , '' he says . `` Only when they start seeing some of those rates come through will they realize how low the rates are they agreed to . ''
Gerard 's decision to reject two plans is something officials in Connecticut are concerned about . If reimbursement rates to doctors stays low in Obamacare plans , more doctors could reject those plans . And that could mean that people will get access to insurance , but they may not get access to a lot of doctors .
That worries Kevin Counihan , who runs Connecticut 's health insurance marketplace .
`` I think it could lead potentially to this kind of distinction that there is these different tiers of quality of care , '' he explains .
His agency recently approved rules geared at getting more providers into plans on the exchange . The goal is to make sure that everyone gets good care regardless of their income — and that consumers recognize it .
`` The [ perception that there are ] different tiers of quality of care means somehow that the people think that just because my income is below 400 percent of the federal poverty level , I 'm going to get inadequate care or lesser care than someone making above 400 percent , '' says Counihan . `` That 's been something , at least in our state , that we 're trying to work against . And the carriers are , as well . ''
NPR asked all three of the insurers on Connecticut 's exchange to comment . Two declined but one agreed . Ken Lalime is the CEO of Healthy CT — an insurance co-op . He says insurers face a real challenge figuring out how to pay doctors enough but also keep consumer premiums low .
`` Every time you increase payments to providers , you have to offset that with increased reimbursement from the consumer . So there 's this balance between how much do you want to cost to provide that service ... and how much you can pass along in your premium rates . So it 's a balancing act , '' he says .
Healthy CT may have missed the balance — just 3 percent of the exchange 's consumers bought their insurance 2014 . Lalime says he also thinks low reimbursement rates are forcing some doctors to decide against accepting insurance under the Affordable Care Act .
Dr. Bob Russo is sure of it . He 's a radiologist and he 's also the president-elect of the Connecticut State Medical Society . He says that the low rates and administrative burdens that come along with the ACA could make it a financial loser .
`` You get what you pay for , '' he says . `` If you ca n't convince [ doctors ] that they 're not losing money doing their job , it 's a problem . And they have n't been able to convince people of that . ''
He , like Counihan , worries about creating a tiered health care system . Think about Medicaid , he says . Before a recent rise in rates , it paid doctors even less than Medicare , so many stopped accepting Medicaid patients .
`` There 's no question that Medicaid , under its old rates , was n't working , '' he says . `` So , have we just invented a new Medicaid that kind of slid the scale up a little more to make access a little more ? ''
The experience of these doctors is a good reminder that the Affordable Care Act is more than a thought exercise in health care — it 's happening now . Open enrollment for 2015 begins in just over three months .
