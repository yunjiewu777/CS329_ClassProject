Nancy Jean Beigel , one of those who appeared in the Rose Garden with President Obama recently as an example of someone who would benefit from ObamaCare , immediately encountered problems when she tried to enroll .
Beigel told the Washington Post she tried for two days to sign up before giving up for now . `` It 's a little confusing , '' she said .
Others , who have gotten letters from their insurance carriers telling them exactly how much they will pay , are upset for different reasons .
Tom Gialanella of Seattle , who is self-employed , told ███ , `` my premiums would increase approximately 61 percent . I went from $ 891 a month to $ 1437 dollars a month . And also my deductibles all doubled . ''
The letter from his insurer said his current deductible for his family of five would double from $ 4,000 a year to $ 8,000 .
Even though that 's for the Bronze Plan , the least expensive option under ObamaCare , he says his additional payment of $ 550 a month will give him a plan that is no better than what he already has . What ’ s more , it also it carries a benefit his family does not need : maternity and newborn care .
`` My wife is 58 years old and our youngest child is soon to be 18 , '' says Gialanella . `` We 'll be having no more children . That is not a benefit that we would ever purchase nor need or be able to use . ''
Gialanella is almost 60 and makes too much money to get any subsidies .
Young people , especially , young men , can face huge premium increases .
Chris Holt of the conservative American Action Forum says , `` we said let 's look at what the lowest cost Bronze Plan is and compare that to the lowest cost plan that I can buy today . And what we found is that it will go up about 260 percent for a 30-year-old male . ''
Recent reports from the Midwest indicated increases of more than 100 percent , but not as much as Holt found .
Part of the problem is that young people will be forced to buy more benefits than they might be willing to pay for , as a recent survey found .
`` For young adults , Holt said of one recent survey , `` if they saw 30 percent increase in their insurance premiums - these are the ones that already had coverage - 45 percent of them said they would drop coverage . ''
Only two states in the country , New Jersey and Massachusetts , showed rate increases for that age group lower than 30 percent .
But what about the subsidies in ObamaCare that are most generous at lower income levels ?
For any young person making more than $ 20,000 a year , insurance premiums -- not even counting deductibles of several thousand dollars -- would cost more than paying the penalty for not getting insurance .
That raises the prospect of young people deciding the plan makes no sense for them .
That possibility could be critical , because the administration is counting on signing up enough young , healthy people to offset the cost for the older and less healthy .
If that doesn ’ t happen , the costs of ObamaCare could soar .
