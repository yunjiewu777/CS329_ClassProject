The Obama administration , in an 11th-hour change , announced significant exemptions for people who recently lost their insurance coverage and are struggling to get a new plan -- drawing immediate criticism from the insurance industry and Republican lawmakers .
Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius confirmed the changes , which include letting those individuals skirt the law 's individual mandate , in a letter to senators . She said she would allow people who got cancellations and could not find affordable new coverage to qualify for a `` hardship exemption '' in order to avoid a penalty next year for not having insurance .
Further , she announced that those individuals will be able to purchase bare-bones plans that until now were available only for people under 30 .
The move , though , to allow potentially hundreds of thousands of people to sign up for `` catastrophic '' coverage plans was criticized by the insurance industry as a shift that would cause `` tremendous instability . ”
The administration , which made the announcement right before the holiday break and as President Obama prepared to fly to Hawaii for vacation , downplayed the sudden change , saying they expected it to impact fewer than 500,000 people .
Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters said , `` This is a common sense clarification of the law . For the limited number of consumers whose plans have been cancelled and are seeking coverage , this is one more option . ''
An insurance industry official told ███ that while the administration was playing down the significance of the move , it could turn out to be a troublesome last minute change and the industry fears far more than the 500,000 people will apply .
Another industry official , America 's Health Insurance Plans spokesman Robert Zirkelbach , said , “ This type of last-minute change will cause tremendous instability in the marketplace and lead to further confusion and disruption for consumers . ''
Democrats praised the steps as a common-sense backup in a difficult situation while Republicans panned the administration action as another patch to an unworkable law .
`` Holding a fire sale of cheap insurance is not a responsible fix for a broken program . This is a slap in the face to the thousands of Americans who have already purchased expensive insurance through the ObamaCare exchanges , '' Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , said in a statement .
House Energy and Commerce Committee Vice Chairman Marsha Blackburn , R-Tenn. , described the move as `` another major policy shift '' from the Obama administration .
`` We asked Secretary Sebelius point blank what would be the next holiday surprise , and she was silent . Yet , here we are with another major policy shift . The sad reality is that when the law takes effect come January 1 , more Americans will be without coverage under Obamacare than one year ago , '' Blackburn said in a statement released Thursday evening .
`` Less than two weeks from going live , the White House seems to be in full panic mode . Rather than more White House delays , waivers , and exemptions , the administration should provide all Americans relief from its failed law . ''
On Thursday , the administration estimated at less than 500,000 those who have not yet found other coverage in the wake of seeing their coverage canceled .
Obama was roundly criticized for reneging on a longstanding promise that if you liked your plan , you would be able to keep it under his health care law . The president apologized , and then said insurers could extend those plans for one more year . Most state regulators followed Obama 's lead and gave insurance companies the additional latitude , but it 's unclear whether the problem has been fully resolved .
Insurers are concerned that healthy customers who potentially would have bought full coverage may now stay out of the market , leaving the companies with a group of patients in worse health overall .
