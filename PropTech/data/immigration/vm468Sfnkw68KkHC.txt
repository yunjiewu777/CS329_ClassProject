Texas Governor Greg Abbott said law enforcement and other officials implementing sanctuary policies that release criminal aliens with immigration detainers will now be subject to the “ stiffest penalties in America. ” He also rebutted the hype and fear mongering being spread by some legislators , liberal chiefs of police , sheriffs , and media outlets .
Abbott ’ s comments came during an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas immediately following his signing of the historic bill that effectively outlaws sanctuary jurisdictions in the Lone Star State . The new law creates civil and criminal penalties for those who refuse to cooperate with immigration officials and provides for jail time for a sheriff or police chief who releases a criminal alien subject to an immigration detainer . He also took the opportunity to counter the claims that this is a “ show me your papers ” law and is somehow unconstitutional .
Democrat legislators and left-of-center Texas news outlets claims about the constitutionality of a provision in the law allowing police officers to inquire about the immigration status of someone they have detained drew pointed criticism from the governor . In an article published April 29 in the Dallas Morning News , State Representative Rafael Anchia ( D-Dallas ) said SB4 is unconstitutional because states are pre-empted by federal law in the area of immigration and are not permitted to conduct their own investigation . “ The Supreme Court struck down most of the provisions of the Arizona immigration law on this basis . ”
Abbott told Breitbart Texas this article “ directly misstated what the legal status of this law was out of the U.S. Supreme Court – in the Arizona decision . ”
“ The so-called controversial part of this law is what some label as the “ show your papers ” component , ” the Texas governor explained . “ And what everyone seems to get wrong is they think that that provision was stricken down in the Arizona law . To the contrary , the provision in the Arizona law is stricter than the Texas law . The Arizona law required that law enforcement ASK for papers . The Texas law does not require it , it allows it so there is that one difference . ”
“ But despite that difference , the Arizona law was upheld by every U.S. Supreme Court justice , including the liberals , ” he said emphatically . “ The so-called controversial part of this law has been ruled on by the U.S. Supreme Court and upheld , ” the governor emphasized .
Abbott reassured American citizens living in Texas this bill does nothing to change their daily lives . “ For American citizens , this bill has no impact on them whatsoever , and they have absolutely nothing to be concerned about , ” Abbott reassured . “ There ’ s only one group of people that is targeted by this legislation and that is people who are in this country illegally , who have committed violent crimes , and are subject to an ICE detainer request . ”
“ No one has to do anything different from the way they ’ ve been operating their lives before this law was signed , ” he said referring to a situation where someone is stopped for a traffic violation , ” because it poses no danger , no challenge , no difficulty , for any American citizen . ”
The law ’ s author , Senator Charles Perry ( R-Lubbock ) , said police can already inquire about the immigration status of a person they detain , during a Q & A on the Senate Floor during final passage of the bill . He said this bill doesn ’ t change anything in this regard and citizens and legal residents do not need “ carry papers ” to prove they are here legally .
The new law does pose a threat to law enforcement officials who choose to ignore detainer requests on illegal immigrants in their jails from immigration officials .
“ All law enforcement officers are going to be required to follow this law , ” the governor stated . “ If they refuse to follow this law , or if they adopt sanctuary city policies , they are subject now to the stiffest penalties in America for adopting sanctuary city policies – which includes jail time where sheriffs could wind up in the same jail they may be releasing inmates from who are the subject of ICE detainer requests . ”
“ But these officials also are subject to a removal action , ” he advised , “ and the counties or cities in which they operate are subject to very stiff fines. ” The governor said these fines can go up to $ 25,000 per day . The law makes ignoring an immigration detainer a Class A misdemeanor , Breitbart Texas reported .
Referring to Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez and Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez , who have either ignored or threatened to ignore immigration detainers , Abbott said they must come into compliance with the law . “ If they don ’ t change their policies , if they continue to handle detainers on a case-by-case basis that means they will be in violation of this law and subject to its penalties , ” he said firmly .
Governor Abbott explained that he believes this law will make Texas a safer place and help avoid tragedies like what happened in the sanctuary city of San Francisco with the murder of Kate Steinle by a previously deported illegal alien released from the local jail .
“ This law makes Texans safer because it prevents the types of policies that California has that lead to the tragic murder of Kate Steinle . It prevents the types of policies that were adopted by the Travis County sheriff who had policies that release back out on the street , people who are either accused of , or even convicted of , very dangerous crimes and so Texas is going to be a safer place by ensuring that law enforcement will work with federal officials to ensure that we keep behind bars , and remove from this country , those who pose a danger to our fellow Americans . ”
The new sanctuary city law goes into effect September 1 , 2017 .
