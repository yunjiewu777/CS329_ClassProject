Former South Carolina Republican senator and current Heritage Foundation president Jim DeMint argued that implementing immigration reform as proposed by the so-called `` Gang of Eight '' would `` cost Americans trillions of dollars , '' citing a soon-to-be released update to the conservative group 's 2007 study on the impact of immigration reform .
`` The study you 'll see from Heritage this week presents a staggering cost of another amnesty in our country , '' DeMint said this morning on `` This Week , '' based on the `` detrimental effects long-term '' of government benefits that would eventually go to the millions offered a path to citizenship under the reform legislation currently being considered . `` There 's no reason we ca n't begin to fix our immigration system so that we wo n't make this problem worse . But the bill that 's being presented is unfair to those who came here legally . It will cost Americans trillions of dollars . It 'll make our unlawful immigration system worse . ''
A 2007 study by Robert Rector , assuming all undocumented immigrants were granted `` amnesty , '' said the cost to the United States of immigration reform would be at least $ 2.6 trillion . When asked if the new Heritage estimate would be more than $ 2.5 trillion , DeMint responded `` much more than that . ''
The 2007 study is not without its critics , such as Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute , who wrote in April that the study 's `` flawed methodology produced a grossly exaggerated cost to federal taxpayers of legalizing unauthorized immigrants while undercounting or discounting their positive tax and economic contributions . ''
DeMint dismissed the criticisms , including estimates by the Congressional Budget Office that say immigration reform will increase economic growth .
`` Well , CBO said Obamacare would n't cost us anything . They 're basically puppets of the Congress and the assumptions they put in the bill . Heritage is only organization that has done an analysis on the cost , '' DeMint said .
`` If you consider all the factors related to the amnesty - and , believe me , this is comprehensive - that it will have a negative long-term impact on our gross domestic product , '' DeMint added . `` So we just want Congress , for once , to count the cost of a bill . They 're notorious for underestimating the cost and not understanding the consequences . ''
