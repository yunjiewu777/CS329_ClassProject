The administration had hoped to have some 800,000 people in the exchanges by now . Report : 100K ACA sign-ups in Nov .
About 100,000 people signed up on the flawed federal Obamacare website in November , Bloomberg reported , quoting one source familiar with the program ’ s progress .
Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters would not confirm the specific number but did say the agency expects the final numbers will show an increase for November .
That number would still be far short of what the White House had hoped for before the severity of the website ’ s defects became apparent . But it would still be about four times the puny sign-up of under 27,000 in October . Several states running their own exchanges have also been reporting steady climbs in enrollment — although a few like Oregon are still facing technical problems hampering sign-up .
“ We ’ re in the process of scrubbing final data and expect to report November numbers in mid-December , but we expect that enrollment will increase with the technical improvements we ’ ve made , enrollment taking place across our customer service channels and the surge in enrollment that many states who are running their own marketplaces have reported , ” Peters said . “ At the same time , it ’ s important to remember we are just two months into a six-month open enrollment period that we expect will ramp up over time as we ’ ve seen in other implementation efforts , such as Massachusetts and Medicare Part D . ”
The administration had hoped for about 800,000 people in the state and federal exchanges by now , and about 7 million by the end of March . Officials announced over the weekend they had met their targets for making key fixes to the website , which is now working faster and with fewer crashes and errors . But they acknowledged the website is far from perfect despite the repair effort , and will need more work .
