The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) model cited by White House Coronavirus Task Force officials has increased its projections of the number of coronavirus deaths in the United States by August 4 to 93,765 .
The projection is based on key assumptions about the implementation of social distancing policies , the IHME said in a statement released on Wednesday :
These estimates assume the strong continuation of statewide social distancing measures in places where they are already enacted , and future adoption within the next seven days in states without them . If such policies are relaxed or not implemented , the US could experience a higher COVID-19 death toll and hospital burden than what our models currently predict .
The model now projects 12,651 more deaths in the United States than it projected five days ago when its first projection of 81,114 coronavirus deaths was announced on March 26 . The model ’ s estimation of coronavirus deaths has increased with every published update . On Monday , March 30 , at 6:00 a.m. Pacific Time , the model projected 82,141 coronavirus deaths by August 4 . Just 24 hours ago , on Tuesday , March 31 , at 6:00 a.m. Pacific Time , the IHME model projected 83,967 coronavirus deaths in the United States by August 4 .
Wednesday ’ s projections represent an increase in estimated coronavirus deaths of 9,798 based on a single day of new data . The model is dynamic , and its projections for the country and individual states are updated every 24 hours at 6 a.m. Pacific Time based on the most recently reported data .
The increase “ is primarily driven by increasing death tolls in states that previously had very few COVID-19 deaths . States with more COVID-19 deaths , such as New York and Washington , show far less fluctuation across daily updates . If the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths rise by state , we expect increasing accuracy for predictions across states , the IHME said in Wednesday ’ s statement .
The sensitivity of the model ’ s projections to new data confirms what White House Corona Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci has stated about epidemiological modeling of the course of the coronavirus pandemic : “ it ’ s a moving target . ”
Today ’ s estimates show that nationwide , COVID-19 deaths are predicted to peak on April 16 , when we predict 2,607 deaths ( range of 1,294 to 4,140 ) in a single day . This projection is higher than our estimates released on March 31 , which projected peak US COVID-19 deaths at 2,214 ( range of 1,106 to 3,321 ) on April 15 . April 16 also is now estimated as the peak hospital use date in the US . At this peak date , the US is projected to need 260,342 total hospital beds ( 38,849 for ICU ) and 31,082 ventilators to support COVD-19 patients . This could equate to a projected shortage of 84,671 total hospital beds and 18,905 ICU beds given current COVID-19 trajectories .
The statement also provided these additional details on data updates and how they influenced the model ’ s new estimates :
Our COVID-19 death modeling approach involves fitting state-specific curves with CurveFit ( see documentation here ) wherever there is sufficient data and an average curve for other states . In today ’ s release , we were able to fit state-specific curves for three additional states : Alabama , Delaware , and Iowa . This resulted in important changes in today ’ s estimates for these states .
Notably , fitting on new data released on March 31 , the cumulative COVID-19 death estimates for Alabama increased to 7,334 . . . an estimate that is 6,161 deaths higher than previous estimates .
13 other states still use “ average curves ” for their prediction fits . Our daily projection updates for these states are less stable a day-to-day . This is because uncertainty ( the range ) is much higher in the absence of more data . These 13 states are Alaska , Hawaii , Maine , Montana , Nebraska , New Hampshire , New Mexico , North Dakota , Rhode Island , South Dakota , Utah , West Virginia , and Wyoming .
An updated estimate of total coronavirus deaths , hospital capacity , and peak days as projected by the IHME model is expected to be released at 6:00 am Thursday , April 2 .
The IHME COVID-19 model research project is run by Professor Christopher J. L. Murray of the University of Washington , the director of the IHME . “ Funding was provided by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the State of Washington , ” according to the report on the study published on March 30 at MedRxiv .
