House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , on Friday condemned the use of the term `` wetbacks '' by Rep. Don Young , R-Alaska , one of the party 's most senior members of Congress .
Young 's statement , his quick apology , and Boehner 's statement that the remark was `` beneath the dignity of the office he holds , '' come at a particularly sensitive time for the Republican Party in its relationship with Hispanic voters .
Latinos voted overwhelmingly for President Obama in November , and the GOP is attempting to navigate calls for changes in immigration law , with more party leaders now backing a so-called path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants , which is opposed by many conservatives .
Young used the term `` wetbacks '' in describing Hispanic migrant workers who used to pick tomatoes on his father 's family ranch . He made the comments in an interview released Thursday with an Alaska radio station .
`` My father had a ranch . We used to hire 50 or 60 wetbacks and â€” to pick tomatoes , '' Young said . `` You know , it takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now . It 's all done by machine . ''
In a later statement , Young , 79 , who has spent four decades in Alaska 's only U.S. House seat , said he `` meant no disrespect '' in using the term , a slur for Mexicans crossing illegally into the United States . The Alaska Dispatch reported the apology :
`` During a sit down interview with Ketchikan Public Radio this week , I used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California . I know that this term is not used in the same way nowadays and I meant no disrespect . `` Migrant workers play an important role in America 's workforce , and earlier in the ... interview , I discussed the compassion and understanding I have for these workers and the hurdles they face in obtaining citizenship . America must once and for all tackle the issue of immigration reform . ''
