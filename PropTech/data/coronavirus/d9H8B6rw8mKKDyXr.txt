Amid a rapid fire set of orders from a podium in the State House during a rare Sunday evening news conference , Baker also lowered the threshold for any public gatherings from the 250-person limit he set last week to 25 . His actions amount to some of the most aggressive responses in the country . The new limit applies to all community , civic , public , leisure , faith-based events , as well as sporting events with spectators , concerts , and conventions . It covers fitness centers , private clubs and theaters .
Baker announced Sunday that all bars and restaurants in Massachusetts would be shut down to on-premise consumption starting Tuesday through April 17 .
Governor Charlie Baker on Sunday night ordered all public and private schools across Massachusetts to close for three weeks , beginning Tuesday , and has limited all restaurants to only takeout and delivery as of Tuesday , in his most sweeping action yet to slow the increasing rate of the spread of the novel coronavirus .
“ If we take decisive steps now and everyone plays their part by following the best medical guidance , we can slow down the spread , ” he said .
The governor stressed that grocery stores and pharmacies will remain open , pleaded with people not to hoard , and again noted that stores were getting regularly restocked .
The new restrictions on schools , restaurants and large gatherings will be lifted April 6 . At the same time , however , the US Centers for Disease Control recommended that gatherings of 50 people or more be canceled or postponed over the next eight weeks .
The orders came against the backdrop of a spike of 26 new cases , bringing the total number of infected residents to 164 . As of 6 p.m. Sunday , state officials said 969 residents had been tested — more than double the number from the day before . State officials also said Sunday that there is now evidence of community spread in seven Massachusetts counties : Berkshire , Essex , Hampden , Norfolk , Middlesex , Suffolk , and Worcester . That means residents are contracting the illness but the specific source of the infection is unknown .
“ The facts on the ground have changed , ” Baker said . “ Now that we have evidence based on the testing results that we have community transmission in seven counties in Massachusetts , I think at this point in time it ’ s particularly appropriate we not only move on the school closures , but also that we get a lot more aggressive around other places and spaces that people gather . ”
The goal of the governor ’ s orders — and a variety of other new restrictions on public life across the state and the country — is to stem the wave of infections by keeping Americans apart from each other . That , experts hope , will help avoid overloading the health care system .
“ This is a time of shared sacrifice , ” Mayor Martin J. Walsh said Sunday . “ It will save lives . ”
Baker ’ s orders came as governors in Illinois and Ohio also announced restrictions on bars and restaurants . New York City announced a shutdown of schools through at least April 20 .
The new restrictions in Massachusetts came on yet another day of dizzying coronavirus news in the state . Earlier in the day Walsh declared a public health emergency in the city , imposing restrictions on restaurants , bars , and clubs .
The coronavirus outbreak has now infected a pair of health care providers at Brigham and Women ’ s Hospital , the Boston hospital said Sunday .
And a worker at the Marriott Long Wharf hotel — the host of a February Biogen conference that was the source of many of the state ’ s cases — also tested positive for the Covid-19 , the disease caused by the virus .
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority leaders said Sunday that they would run normal service Monday to service a dwindling ridership amid the outbreak . But the MBTA acknowledged that it could eventually follow other cities , including Washington , D.C. , in cutting back the frequency of trains and buses . MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo said the agency is working on “ contingency plans ” that could lead to reductions .
Baker on Sunday also ordered a broad array of additional responses to the pandemic , some of which will require approval by the Legislature this week . But even before outlining the new rules , he cautioned residents to ignore one widespread rumor .
“ We are not planning any shelter-in-place orders , ” Baker said . “ Everyone needs to get news from legitimate sources . ”
The governor said he would order commercial health insurers to allow patients to receive care via tele-health , letting them avoid in-person appointments . He directed hospitals to postpone elective surgeries , to make space for Covid-19 patients . And he prohibited visitors to assisted living residences ; this is in addition to the federal ban issued Friday on visitors to nursing homes and rest homes .
The governor also authorized licensed pharmacies to create and sell hand sanitizer over the counter .
Baker said he will extend some deadlines for motorists to renew documents at the Registry of Motor Vehicles , in an attempt to limit in-person transactions .
He hopes to expand eligibility for collecting unemployment and wants to give municipalities the power to delay town meetings and the adoption of municipal budgets .
The governor ordered executive branch employees to stay home Monday and Tuesday and said his administration would work to expand alternative work arrangements for them going forward .
And he recommended that all Massachusetts colleges and universities pursue strategies for distance education , keeping students from campus . Most major universities in the Boston area have already done so .
Baker did not order the closure of child-care programs but strongly urged providers to strictly observe guidelines that call for temporary closures based on actual direct or indirect exposures to individuals with Covid-19 .
At the Brigham , where the two health care workers were reported infected , hospital leaders said in a memo to staff that they are in close contact with state and city public health officials and are following their guidance about how to proceed .
“ As the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe , it is inevitable that health care workers will be infected , as is now the case at the Brigham , ” wrote Dr. Charles Morris , associate chief medical officer and incident commander . ''We are in the process of contacting patients and staff who may have been exposed . ''
`` While this news is unsettling , please be assured that our Brigham community has been preparing for this eventuality , and we will continue to take every precaution to protect our patients , their loved ones and our staff throughout this unprecedented pandemic , '' wrote Morris . The memo was also signed by Julia Sinclair , senior vice president of clinical services and incident commander .
Brigham spokesperson Erin McDonough said the providers did not work while symptomatic . She said the hospital can not identify or release details about the providers or their specific jobs because of privacy rules . Another person with knowledge of the situation said they are both doctors .
McDonough said in an e-mail that the hospital undertook an “ intensive tracing process ” that involved a detailed review of every patient and employee the providers interacted with during a particular time period .
Amid all the precautions about the coronavirus spread , government leaders were aghast Sunday at reports of crowds spotted flocking to bars and restaurants in South Boston Saturday night .
The city ’ s Licensing Board moved swiftly Sunday — even before Baker ’ s broader restrictions were announced in the evening — announcing a voluntary agreement with more than a dozen bars and restaurants to shut down .
The mayor announced in the morning that he would restrict Boston restaurants , bars , and clubs to half their capacity and to close their doors each night by 11 . But Walsh ’ s order was ultimately overtaken by Baker ’ s broader bans .
Meanwhile , Sunday , Senator Edward J. Markey called for a wartime-like mobilization of private manufacturing to supply hospitals with the tests and protective equipment they need to handle the novel coronavirus .
In a Boston press conference , Markey urged the Trump administration to use the Defense Production Act , a law passed near the start of the Korean War in 1950 , to mobilize private industry for defense production . Markey called for exponential increases in production of testing kits and protective gear such as respirator masks for health care workers .
Markey ’ s comments were echoed by Dr. Peter Slavin , the president of Massachusetts General Hospital , who said he ’ s worried about the shortage of personal protective equipment needed to keep doctors and nurses safe as they confront rising numbers of infected patients .
“ We need to think of this in almost a war-like stance , ” Slavin said on NBC ’ s Meet the Press .
“ Even before the most significant battles [ that ] lie ahead , our supplies are low , '' he said of the protective gear . `` We wouldn ’ t want to send soldiers into war without helmets and armor . We don ’ t want to do the same with our health care workers . ”
