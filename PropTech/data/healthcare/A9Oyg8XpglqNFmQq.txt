Americans began heading anew this weekend to President Obama ’ s official Obamacare Facebook page to gather information on the new round of health care enrollment , share their experiences shopping for insurance on the federal exchange and voice their opinions on the president ’ s signature domestic achievement .
However , what some would view as a robust marketplace of ideas is actually controlled by just a few , an analysis of the Web page shows .
Sixty percent of the site ’ s 226,838 comments generated from September 2012 to early last month can be attributed to fewer than 100 unique profiles , according to an analysis completed by The ███ with assistance from an outside data analytics team . Many of those profiles belong to just one person who created multiple aliases or personas to widen her influence and multiply her voice .
Cindi Huynh , an Obamacare supporter in California , posted on average 59 times a day on the site in 60 days , making her the No . 1 poster in that period . She posted only during work hours — as is the trend of the top 25 posters on the site — and never on weekends .
Over the past two years , Ms. Huynh has been a prolific poster — ranking twice in the top 25 profiles contributing to the site — once under the name “ Cindi Huynh ” and again as “ Cyndi Huynh Vellucci . ”
Ms. Huynh has had at least four Facebook profiles , she confirmed .
Ms. Huynh told The Times that she has never been paid for her posts but has volunteered for the California Democratic Party and was approached to become an Obamacare patient advocate . She said she was too busy to contribute in that way and felt she could better spread the message online . She has a full-time job but has declined to name her employer .
Copious posters on the Obamacare site , like Ms. Huynh , were not all so easily identifiable . Once The Times made known it was conducting an investigation into the audience on the site , at least three pro-Obamacare commentators disappeared or deactivated their accounts .
• Wanda Milner has posted 4,695 times in the entire timeline evaluated , putting her in the top 25 commentators . Ms. Milner , who is from Canada , told The Times she was passionate about the issue and decided to get active about it . She denied having any aliases or being paid for her actions , but said fake pages were created to mock her . She has “ liked ” many of Ms. Huynh ’ s comments as well as those of other pro-Obamacare posters .
• Paul J. Nunley is an anti-Obamacare poster who made 2,316 posts in 60 days , ranking only behind Ms. Huynh . A retired veteran from New Mexico , Mr. Nunley said he dedicates his full time to the site to try to “ rid it of misinformation. ” In the process of doing so , he has made friends with Ms. Huynh and other top posters , and has engaged in online fighting , leading to multiple timeouts of his profile .
• Eileen A. Wolf , from North Dakota , posted 5,870 times in the entire period evaluated and 325 times in 60 days . She also used the account of her husband , James Wolf , to post prolifically under his name , Mr. Wolf said .
The official Obamacare page is controlled by Organizing for Action , the president ’ s former political action committee and now a nonprofit group . It has more than 771,000 Facebook “ likes ” and is updated every day with a new link promoting the policy .
The more likes , links , content and comments generated off the site move it higher in the list of Google searches , meaning the very few who are posting on the site obsessively are able to drive it as a top return in another person ’ s Google search — no matter the ideological tilt of the comments .
Organizing for Action declined to comment to The Times when asked whether it hired paid commentators to post on the site during high-traffic days or tried to spur online conversation through volunteers .
Organizing for Action also handles the president ’ s Twitter feed . This summer , it was found that nearly half of the president ’ s 43 million followers at the time appeared to be fake , according to researchers at Barracuda , a computer security company in Campbell , California . Organizing for Action also declined to comment at that time .
Organizing for Action employs Blue State Digital , the digital public relations mastermind behind Mr. Obama ’ s revolutionary online campaign , both in 2008 and 2012 , according to Blue State Digital ’ s website . The firm is cited by its peers as a leader in using digital tools to create both a persuasive and informative online forum .
It was Blue State Digital that invented an online tool for users to organize a campaign event in their hometowns and then watch their Web “ thermometer ” rise as their contacts increased . Once somebody in the social media world sent their email address to the organization , influential people such as first lady Michelle Obama would respond back , relaying the president ’ s talking points for that week .
With Blue State ’ s help , the Obama campaign in 2008 collected the email addresses of 13 million supporters and organized them into lists , segmenting them by social networks , contributions and favored issues , according to a Boston Globe profile written about the firm shortly after Mr. Obama ’ s first winning presidential election .
Blue State Digital , which is based in Boston , declined to comment for this article .
With Facebook ’ s 1.23 billion monthly users and Twitter ’ s more than 240 million , a campaign or political point of view can reach millions instantly and the trends on social media often become segments on the nightly news .
E.J . Dionne told his readers at The Washington Post during the 2012 presidential contest to watch their Twitter feeds to get an unfettered view of who won the second debate .
However , social media is anything but unfettered . It can be leveraged to spread rumors , undercut the opposition or create a false sense of public pressure , computer analysts and public relations representatives say .
“ There have been smear campaigns since Adams and Jefferson in the early 1800s and we ’ re seeing the same thing here , with just a new set of tools , ” said Richard Levick , chairman and chief executive officer of Levick , a public relations and strategic communications firm in Washington .
“ Where do undecided voters , journalists go to get their information ? Google . So controlling the search engine is hugely important . We need to know who is our audience , how do we reach them , how do we engage them , and then , how do we control the territory ? ” he said .
Many digital public relations shops are deploying social media robots , or “ socialbots , ” built by software programmers and deployed by political campaigns to block Twitter feeds , build support for otherwise unpopular opinions and create a flood of content for their own agendas that hopefully will end up in someone ’ s Facebook or Twitter feed and then be liked or reposted by a real individual .
The technique has been so widely used that the National Science Foundation and the Defense Department have awarded a grant to Indiana University to study the phenomenon and develop an application to detect whether a real person or an android is sending a social media message .
The select few masquerading as a crowd are hijacking social media to “ effectively attack the democratic process , ” said P. Takis Metaxas , a computer science professor at Wellesley College who studied social media manipulation in the 2012 election cycle .
“ As social animals , we are influenced by our peers ’ opinions in many ways . In our research we have seen political zealots interested in the electoral results , time and time again . They do not want to let chance , or their enemies , determine an electoral outcome . So they try to create content that would fool social networks into promoting their own candidates and , in some cases , into spreading lies to the detriment of their opponents , ” Mr. Metaxas said .
For example , during the 2010 U.S. Senate special election campaign in Massachusetts , Mr. Metaxas found an attacker used nine Twitter alias accounts to send about 1,000 tweets in a little over two hours . Real users retweeted the message and it reached more than 60,000 people in one day .
The “ Twitter bomb ” seemed to come from a group of concerned citizens , but it likely started with one person or political group trying to alter public opinion , Mr. Metaxas said .
In its annual report , Twitter estimated that less than 5 percent of its 240 million customers — about 12 million — represent fake or alias accounts .
“ As operatives we have to remember that Twitter is not a representative sample . One or two Twitter loudmouths can make minor issues seem tremendously important when they are , in fact , completely irrelevant , ” Mark Harris , a partner at Cold Spark Media and former campaign manager for Sen. Patrick J. Toomey , Pennsylvania Republican , wrote in the July/August issue of Campaigns and Elections .
“ If Twitter is your only news source , which too often it is for many political reporters , some random malfeasance would appear to have seismic repercussions when survey research would show 80 percent of voters are unaware of the issue at all , ” Mr. Harris said .
In terms of Facebook , it is trying to put an end to fake profiles and fake “ likes , ” understanding how misinformation and manipulation can spread .
Facebook , in its annual report , estimated last year that 5.5 percent to 11.2 percent of its users were fake . In January , the company said at least 67.7 million fake accounts were used , a number that could be as high as 137.8 million deploying the company ’ s highest estimate .
Facebook has vowed to “ aggressively get rid of fake likes ” on its network , according to an Oct. 4 posting on its security blog .
The site said it had won more than $ 2 billion against scam artists who sold fake likes in order to make a site seem more popular .
“ We have a strong incentive to aggressively get rid of fake likes because businesses and people who use our platform want real connections and results , not fakes , ” Facebook ’ s security blog said . “ Fake likes are only profitable when they can spread at scale . To make it harder for these scams to be profitable , our abuse-fighting team builds and constantly updates a combination of automated and manual systems that help us catch suspicious activity at various points of interaction on the site , including registration , friending , liking , and messaging . ”
The social and digital battlefield has been set , and those running for office must be able to play , Mr. Levick said .
“ The ‘ aha ’ moment has not occurred yet for most politicians , ” said Mr. Levick . “ Fifteen years after the Model T was developed , buggy whips were still selling exceptionally well . Social and digital media is not a tactic , it ’ s a revolution — just like the Industrial Revolution . It changes everything . ”
