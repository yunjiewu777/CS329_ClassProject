PR Experts : Obamacare Message ( Not Just The Site ) Needs Fix
There 's little doubt that the Obama administration would like a health care website do-over .
Since its rollout Oct. 1 , Obamacare 's online insurance exchange sign-up , critical to success of the health care overhaul , has been a well-documented disaster .
The White House , in addition to managing considerable political fallout , also is dealing with a big , fat public relations problem . Just how does the administration go about winning the trust of the American people after the October Obamacare debacle ?
For some answers , we turned separately to two top public relations executives : Ben Boyd , global chair of corporate practice at Edelman , the world 's largest public relations firm ; and Greg Jenkins , a former official in the George W. Bush White House , and now a San Francisco-based public relations consultant :
NPR : Some have compared the health care rollout to that of `` New Coke , '' the disastrous cola remake . But this strikes me as nothing like that . The Coca-Cola people took a beloved product , tried to change it and simply reverted to the `` classic '' recipe to end the pain . Obamacare is a new product that people are already confused about . Now they 're further confused and many are frustrated . Can you recall another product that had a troubled introduction and how it managed a public relations turnaround ? What were the key elements of the effort ?
Boyd : I also do n't see it as a New Coke . It 's more of a Netflix — a service that was introduced , not a product launch . There was outrage when Netflix changed its pricing structure . The CEO — across multiple channels including letters , YouTube and Facebook — acknowledged the mistake but did n't necessarily have an immediate answer . In a situation like that , it 's almost like stop , drop and roll : Stop the personal investment in defending your decision , and roll forward into what should have been done .
That being said , you have to contextualize this in the political environment . Netflix did not have a public adversary . They dealt with outrage of their consumer base . The administration has had to deal with frustration of the citizenry , and also the political fallout . There is hyper-transparency . It is not a normal service screw up .
Jenkins : Regular people do n't view health care like a soda or a car . The risks of choosing one `` product '' over another are n't life-threatening . Most people are naturally just a little suspicious of government to begin with . That 's part of American DNA . So , when government ca n't make the case for something in simple , compelling terms , either government does n't understand what it 's pushing , or does n't believe in it . Either way , people have a pretty good sense about these things . If it 's a good deal , they 'll take it . If it 's not , they wo n't .
NPR : When President Obama gave his televised speech to apologize for the troubled launch of HealthCare.gov , he recited a 1-800 help number . He was subsequently mocked by some for sounding like an infomercial . Did you find that appropriate ( is n't getting information out there PR rule No . 1 ? ) or was it another stumble that exacerbated the public perception of big trouble ? What should the president 's public role be in recovering from the debacle ?
Boyd : That was such a lose-lose situation . He made a judgment call that speaks to his pragmatism . He saw his primary responsibility as using the bully pulpit to create awareness out there of how people could enroll . It was probably more presidential to read it rather than have a chyron across the bottom of the screen .
NPR : When you look back on the past few weeks and how this has played out , from the White House response to congressional reaction — including Republican efforts to capitalize on the problems to attack the law — what is the biggest public relations lesson the administration should have learned ?
Boyd : You ca n't put lipstick on a pig . In today 's world , what 's been forced on everybody is transparency , even though a lot do n't like it . The changing dynamic in the way we communicate means that everything grows so fast . A lack of confidence in the strength and functionality of the website ? There 's nothing that public relations could have done to fix that . If they were n't at a 99 percent confidence level , they would have been far better to delay it . The buck stops with one person , and that person could have called any number of tech people in the world to find out what it would have taken to make this a success from the start .
Jenkins : The administration failed to appreciate that this is a two-sided coin . It 's not a matter of how poorly the administration positioned the Affordable Care Act , it 's a matter of the administration not appreciating the Republicans ' ability to counter-position ACA . It seems like the administration drank a little of their own Kool-Aid and projected their heartfelt belief in ACA onto a skeptical public .
NPR : Looking forward , and setting aside the obvious political aspect for a moment , what should the administration do to turn around the conversation about Obamacare from `` a disaster '' to , at the very least , something along the lines of `` a potentially valuable work in progress '' ?
Boyd : First , immediately begin talking about the success stories . Tell human stories about the difference the access to health care has made for families , individuals . Work across all channels , in multiple ways . Get labor unions , small business , third parties to tell their stories — that 's more effective .
Second , accountability . This was a massive screw up . People want a reason to believe , and the administration is trying give that — they called it a `` tech surge . '' I got it , but now who 's on it ? Our polling over 13 years shows us that the tech industry is the industry most trusted by the general public . Get a photo of the president sitting at a table with the head of innovation at Microsoft , Intel , and get him , sleeves rolled up , at a computer looking at the website interface . Provide weekly reports that create some public accountability . They ca n't afford not to be transparent about this .
Jenkins : Admit the entry-way to the system is flawed , but is getting fixed — they 're doing that . Then move on and reduce their muddled messaging to two easily understood points directed at the public and nobody else : it 's cheaper , it 's better . If they ca n't easily do that , consumers may conclude it 's a product they simply do n't want .
`` It will take a lot of work , and there are a lot of problems that need to be addressed . But let me be clear . Healthcare.gov is fixable . ''
