WASHINGTON â€“ First lady Melania Trump took a surprise trip to Texas Thursday to visit of a facility housing youth separated from their parents after they crossed the border illegally .
The first lady toured Upbring New Hope Children 's Shelter , which cares for children ages 12 to 17 .
She laughed with the children , asked where they were from and how long they had been there . As she left one classroom , she urged the children to `` be kind and nice to each other . ''
Mrs. Trump was first told that 58 kids were in the shelter , but an employee later informed her that it 's now 55 because three children had been reunited with their families .
`` Oh , that 's great , '' Mrs. Trump said . `` That 's three of them ; they already reunited . ''
She asked the staff questions about their care , how long some have been detained and efforts to reunite them with family .
`` I want to thank you for your hard work and compassion , '' Mrs. Trump said . `` I know you house children for a long-term basis . ''
`` And I would also like to ask you how I can help these children to reunite with their families as quickly as possible , '' she continued .
Speaking before a meeting with his Cabinet , President Donald Trump said watching families being separated has been tough . `` It really bothered her to see this , '' he said . `` We are all bothered by it . ''
`` She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws but also a country that governs with heart , '' Stephanie Grisham , a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump , said earlier this week .
However , the first lady 's trip was slightly overshadowed by her wardrobe choice .
The green jacket she wore while getting on and off the plane read , `` I do n't really care , do u ? '' in big white font across her back .
In a statement , Grisham said it was just a jacket and not a hidden message .
Later , President Trump tweeted , `` ' I REALLY DO N'T CARE , DO U ? ' written on the back of Melania 's jacket , refers to the Fake News Media . Melania has learned how dishonest they are , and she truly no longer cares ! ''
