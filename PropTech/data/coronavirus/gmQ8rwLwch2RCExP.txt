The World Health Organization has been criticized for spreading China ’ s misinformation on COVID-19 and we asked one of the organization ’ s experts if there should be consequences .
John Nosta , who is a member of the Google Health Board , in addition to his work with the WHO , sat down with Daily Caller White House Correspondent Anders Hagstrom to talk the rising COVID-19 numbers in the U.S. , as well as the cause of past outbreaks .
President Donald Trump and others have argued the rising numbers in Florida , Texas and other southwestern states are merely a consequence of an increase in testing . While the falling mortality rate may seem to lend credence to that view , it is also true that the rate at which people are testing positive is also increasing . This indicates an increase in testing is not the sole cause of higher case numbers .
Florida broke the national record for new daily COVID-19 cases Sunday when it reported more than 15,000 , but despite breaking records , Florida hospitals are not seeing the same kind of desperation and lack of resources seen in New York City .

Nosta says part of the reason the mortality rate is lower in southwestern outbreaks is because “ we are taking better care ” of those infected . In other words , the medical infrastructure is better equipped to handle a COVID-19 outbreak in late June than it was in late February .
