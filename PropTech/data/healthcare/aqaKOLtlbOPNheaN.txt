At issue is how the government reimburses dialysis clinics . Until 2011 , the government paid clinics for each dosage of an anti-anemia drug administered , a practice that led to concern that clinics were overusing the drug . But after adopting a flat fee for dialysis , the use of the drug plunged , while the dialysis companies ’ earnings margins rose . That prompted Congress to order a cut in the drug fee .
Some outside experts say the industry is now effectively enlisting patients and members of Congress as a lobbying tool to protect their payments . The real problem , they say , is that the industry continues to open or acquire new clinics even as growth in the number of patients on dialysis nationwide has slowed .
“ Patients should not be used as pawns in a series of scare tactics to protest a change in a payment , ” said Richard Berkowitz of Skokie , Ill. , who said he was repeatedly pressured when he recently visited his dialysis clinic to sign a petition protesting the cuts , even though he routinely does dialysis on his own at home .
The industry — which lists dozens of lobbyists , including former Representative Earl Pomeroy , Democrat of North Dakota , and Thomas A. Scully , who ran the Medicare program from 2001 to 2004 — has proved its clout in Washington before . It persuaded Congress to pass legislation that as of 2011 allowed the industry to receive an annual adjustment in its reimbursement rate , which it will get in the coming year . That will slightly reduce the impact of the other proposed cut .
The federal government for decades has covered the cost of what is called end-stage kidney disease , the only chronic disease that has this automatic coverage . The benefit has cost the government more than $ 32.9 billion a year , the biggest part of it for dialysis . The result is that about 90 percent of the dialysis patients served by a company like DaVita rely at least in part on federal insurance .
