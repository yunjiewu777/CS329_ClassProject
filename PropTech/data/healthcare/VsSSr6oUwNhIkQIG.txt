President Obama will need to more than double the number of Americans enrolled in Obamacare exchange plans to reach 21 million next year , the target set in budget projections , in what is shaping up as the next major test for the health care law .
As of June , the Department of Health and Human Services counted 9.9 million customers who have bought plans through the federal HealthCare.gov portal and a handful of state-run exchanges .
That puts the administration ahead of its own estimates for 2015 , but is less than half what the Congressional Budget Office projected for 2016 , showing just how much work officials have ahead of them as the next round of enrollment begins in less than two months .
Industry analysts said the CBO ’ s estimate for next year is “ overly optimistic ” and a “ stretch , ” and that it will take more time for the law to attract that many people onto the Web-based markets , where consumers shop for private health care plans and typically qualify for government subsidies to reduce their monthly premiums .
“ Given where things stand , the ramp-up of enrollment may be slower than initially anticipated , ” said Elizabeth Carpenter , a vice president at Avalere Health , a D.C.-based consultancy .
Open enrollment for the third go-around of Obamacare ’ s exchanges begins Nov. 1 , and the administration is counting on winning over millions of customers who didn ’ t sign up the first two years but who could be pressured by the increasing pain of the “ individual mandate ” tax assessed on those who forgo health insurance .
“ It is definitely something that people pay attention to , ” said Rachel Klein , director of organizational strategy at Families USA , a nonprofit that advocates for affordable health care .
The tax during the first year was $ 95 or 1 percent of income above the filing threshold — a relatively minor bite . This year , the penalty will be $ 325 or 2 percent of income , and by 2016 it will be $ 695 or 2.5 percent of income .
“ The substantial increase in penalties under the individual mandate next year is a big wild card , ” said Larry Levitt , a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation , a nonpartisan health policy organization . “ We ’ re in unchartered territory here about how effective these bigger penalties will be in nudging people to get insured . ”
“ The marketplaces are working , ” Mr. Levitt added , “ but higher enrollment would both improve the insurance risk pool and reduce the number of Americans uninsured . ”
The individual mandate was included in the Affordable Care Act of 2010 to make sure enough healthy Americans signed up , spreading out the costs for higher-risk customers .
A divided U.S. Supreme Court upheld the mandate in 2012 as an appropriate use of Congress ’ taxing power .
But congressional Republicans are still intent on scrapping the health care law , and may use a fast-track budget procedure known as “ reconciliation ” to take a swing at it .
GOP leaders say they may not be able to eviscerate the law through the budget , but Brendan Buck , a spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan , said repealing the individual mandate is “ definitely on the table . ”
“ This law is only being held together by mandates and coercion , and that ’ s why we continue to look at ways to repeal the mandates and give people more freedom and choices , ” Mr. Buck said .
Even as it struggles to meet the 2016 enrollment projection , the Obama administration is on track on other measures , including a CBO estimate that 17 million fewer people lack insurance this year because of the health care law .
But in setting lofty goals for the exchanges , the CBO estimated the effect of the individual mandate and other potential changes , including the belief that employers would shift workers onto the exchanges or that customers would enter the Obamacare marketplace ahead of late 2017 , when they can no longer hold plans that do not comply with the law .
Under political duress , the White House let customers transition to compliant plans to keep Mr. Obama ’ s notorious promise that people who like their plans can keep them under his law .
Sizing up reality versus long-range estimates , Health and Human Services has begun to set its own , more modest goals for exchange enrollment , ignoring CBO ’ s guess of 12 million for 2015 and setting the mark at 9.1 million enrollees . So far , it ’ s besting its less ambitious goal .
The agency says it is doing its own evaluation of the marketplace and will likely announce its enrollment targets for 2016 before signups begin in November .
“ At this point , the Congressional Budget Office ’ s projected enrollment total for 2016 seems overly optimistic , ” Mr. Levitt said . “ Enrollment may reach that level eventually , but I doubt it will happen by next year . ”
