Virginia isn ’ t the worst off of any state right now , but COVID infection rates have crept up over the past couple of weeks as America continues its nationwide backslide into the pandemic . And yet Virginia remained one of the astoundingly non-zero number of states insisting on an in-person bar exam this month over every bit of public health advice .
But fear not , the state bar examiners have now heard the calls of applicants , doctors , and law school faculty and decided to cancel… the requirement that men wear ties to the exam .
Here is the real Virginia Board of Law Examiners bar exam dress code . The part that is most offensive is the lack of Oxford comma ( after `` skirt and jacket '' ) .https : //t.co/Ex87JXSPpJ pic.twitter.com/3tJ9gliEOo — Zach Wolfe ( @ zachwolfelaw ) July 5 , 2020
Because COVID causes pulmonary issues and we don ’ t want infected applicants struggling with a tie to gasp for air .
The bar exam as a concept is little more than professional cosplay for these people . It is not , in fact , a courtroom or an office or a client meeting . It is not demonstrably useful in protecting the public because it , by design , fails to test applicants on the actual subject material relevant to their future practices ( unlike , say , a series of practice area competency exams people could opt into to earn narrowly tailored certificates ) . It ’ s just a game where they make applicants dress up and play law school trivia .
And unfortunately when the bankruptcy of this endeavor is finally lined up against real human impacts , states are choosing the charade over public health time after time .
