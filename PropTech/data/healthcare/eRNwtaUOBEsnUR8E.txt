President Obama gives his signature health law an “ 8 ” on a scale from 1 to 10 , saying there is still room to improve the 2010 overhaul that ’ s been a political flashpoint since passage .
In an ABC News interview published Wednesday , Mr. Obama touted the Affordable Care Act ’ s progress in cutting the uninsured rate .
“ Sixteen million people or more have health insurance that didn ’ t have it before , ” he said .
He also said the law ’ s price tag has been cheaper than projected , although he ’ s upset that many states have not expanded the Medicaid program for the poor .
Obamacare calls on states to extend the federal-state program to those earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty law . The federal government picks up 100 percent of the expansion ’ s cost in 2014-2016 , before scaling back its contribution to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond .
But the Supreme Court made expansion optional , so only 28 states and the District of Columbia have augmented their programs .
“ We ’ re just seeing some stubbornness that ’ s really based on ideology , not on wise public health policy , that is preventing most people in most states from getting the Medicaid that would save the state money in the long term , ” Mr. Obama told ABC .
The overall health law remains a key target for the Republican-majority Congress , which is hoping to leverage a budget tool known as “ reconciliation ” to pass a filibuster-proof repeal bill , forcing Mr. Obama to veto their will .
Also , the Supreme Court will rule by June whether the administration is unlawfully paying out exchange subsidies to at least 34 states that rely on the federal HealthCare.gov portal . Without the subsidies , the law would be much less attractive in those states , giving the GOP daylight to push their own health reforms .
Mr. Obama has said he is open to changes to his law — he ’ s signed some measures and delayed part of the law — but not the type of Republican-led bills that would scrap its mandates or otherwise hobble it .
