Rising insurance costs may mean Obamacare plays a sizable role in the midterm elections . An Obamacare October surprise ?
Obamacare premiums aren ’ t rising everywhere . They just have a way of finding the states with the biggest Senate races . And that could be very bad timing for Democrats in two of the party ’ s key contests .
Double-digit rate hikes for individual health insurance plans have become an issue in the Louisiana and Iowa Senate races over the past week , where the Republican candidates are hammering their Democratic opponents for the steep premium increases on the way next year for some customers under the Affordable Care Act .
In Louisiana , Rep. Bill Cassidy called the double-digit increases for some insurers — including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana — “ another hurdle for families and businesses already struggling under the demands of Obamacare ” and blamed Democrats for “ false promises ” that premiums would go down . In Iowa , Senate candidate Joni Ernst used the sharp rate increases for two insurers to blast the Democratic candidate , Rep. Bruce Braley , for supporting the law , charging that “ thousands of Iowans are paying for it . ”
The attacks could easily give the impression that the health care law is causing premiums to go through the roof around the country . They ’ re not . In reality , in most states , premiums for coverage in the Obamacare health insurance exchanges for 2015 are rising at about the normal rate for health insurance throughout the country . In some places , they ’ re even going down .
But there are a few states that are facing more extreme premium increases from some insurers — and Louisiana and Iowa are two of them . Alaska , where Democratic Sen. Mark Begich is struggling to win a second term , is another one .
Even there , it ’ s not all insurers that are raising rates that much . Louisiana , for example , is only announcing rates for the insurers that are raising rates by 10 percent or more , so the picture that ’ s being made public is incomplete .
But in an election year , a few states — and a few insurers — are all you need , particularly when they may serve to rekindle passions about a law that was already an Election Day concern for Democrats .
“ In general , the premium increases have been pretty modest . But there are exceptions , and the exceptions happen to be in states with competitive races , ” said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation , who has studied the premium trends around the country .
Republican strategists have been waiting for the big premium increases to show up as an Obamacare “ October surprise. ” They ’ ve been hearing for months through their GOP policy expert contacts that the rate hikes were a possibility , and that because of the timing of the next enrollment season — it starts on Nov. 15 — the increases would become final around now .
Democrats aren ’ t too concerned . It ’ s not as if the issue is dominating the airwaves , after all . With the Louisiana and Iowa Republican Senate candidates , it ’ s been press statements and Twitter for now — although a conservative group did run a TV ad in Alaska that hit Begich over the increases there .
Obama administration officials point out that even in the states with the biggest hikes , most customers won ’ t see them . In Iowa , for example , premiums for the second-lowest-cost “ silver ” health insurance plans — the kind most Obamacare customers buy — will go down by an average of 7 percent in Des Moines .
They also note that the typical premiums for people who get Obamacare subsidies are pretty low to begin with . In Louisiana , for example , the average monthly premium was $ 68 this year for a “ silver ” plan .
But why would the biggest rate hikes single out some of the hottest Senate races in the first place ? There ’ s no conspiracy — it ’ s just the way the electoral math worked out . The states with the biggest increases are usually the ones where the political leaders have resisted the Affordable Care Act and haven ’ t done well at enrollment . And some of those states just happen to have the most competitive Senate races .
A study by PwC ’ s Health Research Institute , which researched premium data in 38 states and the District of Columbia , found that the average increase across states was just 6 percent . Only eight states had double-digit increases — but those states included Louisiana and Iowa , as well as Kansas , where Republican Sen. Pat Roberts is trying to head off a serious challenge from independent Greg Orman .
