When Obamacare was being debated years ago , proponents of the legislation argued that if passed , the bill would decrease emergency room visits due to more people having health insurance and going to regular doctors instead . Since Obamacare was passed in 2010 , we 've seen an increase , not a decrease in ER visits and according to a new poll , the problem is getting worse . More from the Washington Times :
Doctors say emergency room visits have increased since the advent of Obamacare , undercutting one of the key selling points of President Obama ’ s health care law , which was supposed to ensure a healthier population by pushing consumers to rely on their primary physicians rather than emergency trips to the hospital .
Three out of four ER doctors said they have seen a rise in the number of patients since January 2014 , when Obamacare fully kicked in , according to a survey conducted by the American College of Emergency Physicians . More than a quarter of the doctors said they have seen a major surge , and 47 percent said the rise has been slight .
The doctors said they fear a spike in visits could overwhelm their resources : Seven out of 10 said their departments aren ’ t prepared for a significant increase in patient volume .
So why is there a surge in emergency room visits as more people obtain health insurance ? Because Obamacare is wiping out the primary care doctor industry , once again proving `` if you like your doctor , you can keep you doctor '' was a big lie .
The biggest cause is a lack of primary care doctors to treat the increased number of patients with health care coverage , so the patients are turning to the emergency room instead — exactly what wasn ’ t supposed to happen .
“ Just because people have health insurance does not mean they have access to timely medical care , ” said Michael Gerardi , president of the American College of Emergency Physicians .
A 2013 Deloitte Center For Health Solutions Survey found 60 percent of doctors plan to retire early due to Obamacare . This is just the beginning of the ER room crunch , but opponents of Obamacare have been warning about this problem for years .
