The U.S. measles outbreak has shone a light on the growing number of parents opting not to vaccinate their children , despite overwhelming medical reasons to do so . Amid the often-vicious debate between anti-vaxxers and their critics , it 's gone largely unnoticed that when it comes to vaccination rates , the U.S. is out of step with the rest of the world .
Last week , a group of donors that included the U.S. , the U.K. , and the Gates Foundation met in Germany to pledge $ 7.5 billion to Gavi , the vaccine alliance , to pay for its operations to 2020 . Gavi is a global organization that buys vaccines to immunize children in low-income countries .
The alliance has provided billions of dollars ’ worth of new vaccines over the past decade for such conditions as haemophilus influenza and pneumococcal disease , both of which can cause pneumonia and meningitis , as well as rotavirus—the leading global cause of death due to diarrhea under age 5 . Gavi support has translated into more kids being protected against catching and spreading these killer illnesses .
Some Gavi resources have gone toward buying vaccines that even the poorest countries were already providing before they got donor support—including immunizations against diphtheria , whooping cough , and tetanus . The very fact that many of the world ’ s poorest countries are already immunizing against a number of diseases , including measles , and that `` middle income '' countries are providing a growing spectrum of vaccines without any donor support at all , is a demonstration of the level of global commitment against infectious disease that should shame America .
Average health expenditures per person per year—public and private combined—are as low as $ 20 in some of the poorest countries that receive Gavi support and remain below $ 100 in such countries as Nigeria and India . Despite tight resource constraints , those countries are providing the staff and equipment to run national vaccination programs at a cost of $ 20 a child or more—mostly with minimal donor assistance ( which is focused on providing the vaccines themselves ) .
Thanks to this global commitment , alongside U.S. domestic backsliding , America is now a laggard in world league tables of basic vaccination . Nine percent of U.S. kids aren ’ t immunized against measles—that ’ s a higher proportion than in Tajikistan , Zimbabwe , Bhutan , Libya , and 106 other countries . In some U.S. communities , vaccination rates are low enough that the risk of a local epidemic is considerable . In 2014 , a large measles outbreak occurred among unvaccinated Amish communities in Ohio , for example , traced back to a victim who had visited the Philippines during a measles outbreak there . Sadly , the Philippines is one of the minority of countries worldwide with an even lower measles immunization rate than the U.S.—10 percent of children aren ’ t vaccinated on schedule .
It isn ’ t just with measles that the U.S. is a world-lagger . America is 115th worldwide in terms of Hepatitis B vaccination , according to World Health Organization data , with one-10th of one-year-olds not immunized . Six percent of U.S. kids aren ’ t vaccinated against whooping cough–that ’ s higher than Serbia , Burundi , Mongolia , and 89 other countries . And that 's why U.S. whooping cough cases in 2012 were at their highest level since 1955—48,277 infected and 20 related deaths , some of which were among infants too young to be vaccinated .
In the developing world , the spread of immunization coverage has been a central part of declining illness and child deaths—the number of measles deaths globally has fallen from half a million to 100,000 in the 12 years from 2000 , for example . And by considerably reducing the chance that an American travelling abroad will come back with hepatitis B , measles , or whooping cough , developing countries are also making lives safer for the vaccine deniers , immune-suppressed infants , and the allergic in the U.S .
Given its atrocious standing in the vaccination league tables , America should be grateful for the better efforts of much poorer countries to roll out immunizations—and should redouble its support for their fight against infectious disease through vehicles like Gavi . If we want the luxury of denying science and allowing people the choice to expose others to risk , it 's even more important we ensure that other countries are building global immunity and reducing that risk for us all .
