`` COVID-19 continues to rip around the globe , '' John Oliver said on Sunday 's from-his-living-room Last Week Tonight . But the U.S. now has the most confirmed cases in the world , `` and the president has only recently seemed to realize the gravity of the situation . '' Because the federal government `` wasted so much time that we could have spent preparing '' and `` massively botched the rollout of testing for the virus , '' he said , our best shot at slowing this outbreak is strict social distancing .
President Trump and some of his allies think the cost may be too high . `` I 'm in no way minimizing the economic suffering caused by the shutdown , '' Oliver said . `` But the idea that people should sacrifice themselves for the economy is absurd . And yet , it actually gained traction this week . ''
Oliver addressed right-wing market-worshippers like Glenn Beck and the lieutenant governor of Texas : `` You get that the coronavirus is not The Hunger Games , right ? You ca n't volunteer yourself as tribute . And what you 're doing is actually much darker : You 're actively volunteering others , including people of all ages with health conditions , to die . And even if these guys are okay with letting the coronavirus kill as many people as it feels like so that the economy 's protected — which , again : really ? ! ? — there are — and I can not believe I have to say this — significant drawbacks to hundreds of thousands of people dying , '' Among them , such carnage `` also tanks the economy , '' he said . `` So relaxing social distancing right now is n't just trading one bad outcome for another ; it 's trading one bad outcome for both bad outcomes . ''
Oliver ran through some things Trump might have done , and could still do , to forestall a catastrophe . `` This was always going to be hard , '' he said . `` But it actually did n't need to be this hard . And that is why it 's so profoundly disheartening that we 're being led through this crisis by a man who may be less equipped to deal with this historical moment than anybody in recorded history . ''
