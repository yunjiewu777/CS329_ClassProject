Rubio is the star witness at Darrell Issa ’ s hearing . | John Shinkle/███ The Obamacare bailout battle
The latest Republican attack on Obamacare is powerful and simple : “ no insurer bailouts . ”
But never fear , Democrats are ready with a response : “ Well , that ’ s not really what it is . The provision in question is actually called ‘ risk corridors , ’ which is a mechanism for compensating health insurers in case their actual costs are at least 3 percent higher than their projected costs . But it ’ s only temporary , until they get better data on who their customers are . And if their costs are lower than they expected , they actually pay the government . And besides … ”
The last thing Democrats want to do , with a law as complicated and full of moving parts as the Affordable Care Act , is explain what the law actually does .
And yet , they ’ re going to have to come up with something to answer the Republicans ’ latest line of attack . The program that ’ s causing all the trouble is supposed to help insurers get through the first few years of Obamacare if their costs are higher than they thought . And it ’ s not an emergency measure — it was built into the law all along .
But the “ insurer bailout ” charge is already lighting fires on conservative talk radio , and if House Republicans move ahead with plans to attach a repeal of the provision to the next debt ceiling increase , the charge could draw attention way beyond the conservative base — even if the repeal ultimately gets stripped out .
The debate got another showcase on Wednesday , when Florida Sen. Marco Rubio — one of the main Republicans making the charge —was the star witness at House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa ’ s hearing , “ Obamacare : Why the Need for an Insurance Company Bailout ? ”
“ It ’ s time for the president and Secretary [ Kathleen ] Sebelius and for Obamacare supporters to level with taxpayers about the fact that their hard-earned tax dollars will soon be needed to bailout the Obamacare exchanges , ” Rubio told the panel .
It ’ s a strategic problem that ’ s going to plague Democrats every time a fight flares up over a complicated part of the law . The website was actually a simple problem , as embarrassing as it was for the Obama administration : broken website , fix it . But when the fight moves on to the most complicated mechanisms in the law , the Democrats know they ’ ll lose the argument if they get drawn into the weeds .
It ’ s the perfect illustration of the problem Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota captured when Congress was debating the law in 2010 : “ Our bumper sticker has — it ’ s just way too many words . And it says , ‘ Continued on next bumper sticker . ’ ”
Or , as Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis puts it now : “ If you get into the weeds of things , you ’ re dead . ”
The Democrats actually got some good news on Tuesday that could help : The Congressional Budget Office said the provision will save the government $ 8 billion , not cost money . That ’ s because the money can flow both ways . If insurers priced their premiums too high , and their costs are lower than they thought , they pay the government .
But rather than get into a big explanation of all of that , Democrats are more likely to hit the Republicans back with a couple of catchier political points : If you take this out , premiums will rise and it will be your fault .
And by the way , you put the same thing in Medicare Part D , and you didn ’ t complain about it then .
“ They were for risk corridors before they were against them , ” said Drew Hammill , a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi .
Top Democrats are already making use of the one-two punch .
“ Republicans are attacking a program they have supported in the past that is specifically designed to stabilize the insurance market and keep costs down for families , ” Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray said in a statement to ███ . “ Repealing this program would disrupt coverage for millions of Americans who have now gained it thanks to the Affordable Care Act , and would punish families across the country with more uncertainty and higher prices . ”
So is the risk corridors program really a “ bailout ” for insurers ? It ’ s more like a “ shock absorber , ” as health care experts put it — a three-year program that will cushion the blow for health plans because of all the uncertainty about their costs .
At the moment , though , there ’ s no absolute guarantee that it won ’ t cost the government money in the short term , or that the costs have to balance out over the long run . In fact , before Tuesday ’ s CBO report , some analysts worried that the risk has increased since President Barack Obama allowed health insurers to extend policyholders ’ pre-Obamacare health plans , because that ’ s likely to throw off the insurers ’ calculations of their costs even more .
Obama administration officials , however , insist they ’ re going to implement it in a way that doesn ’ t cost money in the long term . The provision “ was estimated to be budget neutral , and we intend to implement it as designed , ” said Aaron Albright , a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services .
